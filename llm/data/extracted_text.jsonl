{"4": "Dissertation Advisor: Professor Yve-Alain Bois Michelle Kuo\n\u201cTo Avoid the Waste of a Cultural Revolution\u201d:\nExperiments in Art and Technology\nABSTRACT\nThis dissertation does not examine a single artist. Rather, it addresses a vast\norganization: Experiments in Art and Technology, or E.A.T., founded in 1966 by artists\nRobert Rauschenberg and Robert Whitman and AT&T Bell Laboratories engineers Billy\nKl\u00fcver and Fred Waldhauer. E.A.T. grew to five thousand members at its peak.\nTogether, they sought to form collaborations between artists and engineers, a grand union\nof culture and technology, of minds, fields, and competencies. They hoped for nothing\nless than \u201cto avoid the waste of a cultural revolution.\u201d But what E.A.T. produced was far\nmore restless, complex, and divided\u2014a sprawling and unruly alchemy. In what follows,\nI offer the first comprehensive analysis of this extraordinary group.\nBuilding on the contemporaneous contravention of conventional models of\ncomposition and intention in the work of Rauschenberg, John Cage, Judson Theater, Pop,\nOp, Happenings, Minimalism, Conceptual, and kinetic art, E.A.T. sought to destabilize\nthe normal process of artistic making, introducing collaboration and conflict into the\nprocess. But the organization also strayed far from the art world, looking instead to a\nvery different realm: big science, the explosion in large-scale research in postwar\niii"}
{"5": "technology, from the military-industrial complex to the rise of the global\ntelecommunications network. Engineers and scientists, in turn, hoped to learn from\nartists\u2014to upend linear teleologies of technological innovation and instrumental reason;\nto think more \u201ccreatively,\u201d in a harbinger of Silicon Valley-speak. I examine the ways in\nwhich these different disciplines convened on the terrain of a shared interest in systems,\ncybernetics, drugs, lasers, computer graphics, electronic sound, plastics, risk; E.A.T.\nthereby modeled a new kind of knowledge transfer and material exchange at a scale never\nbefore seen in the arts. In doing so, I maintain, E.A.T. took on the colossus of universal\nconnectivity\u2014the very goal of AT&T and NASA, military think tanks and corporate\nlaboratories\u2014and posed a new kind of network.\nBy focusing on this unorthodox organization, I hope to redress a blind spot in an\nart historical literature that persists in concentrating on individual artists, historical actors,\nand heroes. Indeed, if most art of the postwar period is seen as challenging traditional\nmodels of individual authorship, few studies have actually examined the most trenchant\nconfrontations with modernist constructions of individual subjectivity, rationality,\nagency, and form. And if much Conceptual art eventually folded radical systems, events,\nand language back into a kind of pure ideation, E.A.T. models a different path for art in\nthe 1960s and \u201970s: a resolutely multiplicitous array of things, people, media,\ninformation, codes, sensations, and temporalities; a massive dispersion and disruption of\ntechnological life, in the ether but also on the ground.\niv"}

{"7": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis dissertation is about a sprawling, singular community. But it is also the\nresult of one: an extraordinary group of friends, colleagues, and family whose support\nfor this project made it possible. I am lucky to have had the best mentor in the world,\nYve-Alain Bois, as my Ph.D. advisor. His brilliance, dedication, wit, and friendship have\nbeen unyielding. He has shown me where to look and how to see. He has changed art\nhistory, but he has also changed the lives and minds of individual students, making a\ncontribution to the field that is both paradigmatic and personal. I am likewise indebted to\nBenjamin H. D. Buchloh and Jennifer Roberts, who joined my dissertation committee\nand provided tremendous insights into method, form, and politics; and I have benefited\nenormously from working with Benjamin as both a reader and a writer, whose critical\nperspective is a model of commitment and urgency.\nAt Harvard, I was lucky to study with and teach for Ewa Lajer-Burcharth; and to\nlearn from the inimitable Robin Kelsey, Neil Levine, David Roxburgh, Henri Zerner, Eric\nRentschler, Harry Cooper, and Deanna Dalrymple. Mary Clare Altenhofen of the Fine\nArts Library and Mary Daniels of the Loeb Design Library were integral to my research\nefforts. My fellow students have become lifelong friends and interlocutors: I am lucky\nto count among them Scott Rothkopf, Aden Kumler, Prudence Peiffer, Jacob Proctor,\nMeredith Martin, Jordan Kantor, Chanchal Dadlani, Brendan Fay, David Kim, Graham\nBader, Benjamin Paul, Gaku Kondo, Jennifer Pruitt, Suzan Yalman, Prita Meier, Leora\nMaltz, Gabriella de la Rosa, Tyler Cann, Cole Roskam, and Cammie McAtee.\nvi"}

{"27": "INTRODUCTION\nThe history of art and technology is a history of envy. The rival fields have long\nchallenged, borrowed, or stolen from each other. Each wants what the other has: Art\ndesires technology\u2019s seeming omnipotence, its cold power, its cutting-edge materials and\nprocesses; technology wants art\u2019s creativity, its free thinking, its radical innovation. And\nyet in spite\u2014or because\u2014of this fraught relationship, art and technology have converged\nin many ways, with enormous consequences for contemporary experience.\nThe jealousy and the joining are the subject of this dissertation. In the study that\nfollows, I examine an extraordinary moment in the twentieth century when artists and\ntechnologists came together, in both antagonism and amity: The formation of\nExperiments in Art and Technology, or E.A.T., an organization that aimed to create\nwidespread collaborations between artists and engineers. Sometimes these encounters\nreflected the postwar dream of universal connectivity, of communications media that\nwould link us all, in global simultaneity. Sometimes they reflected the dystopian\nnightmare of machines run amok, of the horrors of Vietnam and Silent Spring. But often\nthese encounters cannot simply be described as critical or affirmative, utopian or\ndespairing, conflicted or cooperative.1 Sometimes, these collaborations promised a\ndifferent horizon of possibilities, possibilities that did not merely reflect\u2014but actively\nchanged\u2014the colossal proliferation of networks to come.\n1 Thus E.A.T.\u2019s project of overt unification departs, I argue, from the sublimated union between the\nhistorical avant-gardes and instrumental technology, which Andreas Huyssen has described. The futurist\nand constructivist engagements with technology, for example, \u201creveal the secret bond between avant-garde\nand official culture in advanced industrial societies,\u201d whether that use of technology was critical or\naffirmative. Andreas Huyssen, After the Great Divide: Modernism, Mass Culture, Postmodernism\n(Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1986), 173. Emphasis added.\n1"}
{"28": "E.A.T. was founded in 1966 by artists Robert Rauschenberg and Robert Whitman\nand Bell Laboratories engineers Billy Kl\u00fcver and Fred Waldhauer. The group sought to\nform an alliance between artists and engineers, a grand union of disciplines, fields, and\ncompetencies. But what E.A.T. produced was far more restless, complex, and divided\u2014a\nvast and unruly alchemy.\nArt and technology were divided indeed in the late 1960s, infamously split\nbetween the \u201cTwo Cultures,\u201d in the words of Cold War\u2013era doomsdayer C. P. Snow.\nMany warned that this rift would lead to technocratic domination, nuclear winter,\necological ruin. E.A.T. echoed this alarm. As the organization\u2019s inaugural manifesto\nproclaimed, culture and technology were dangerously developing \u201cin isolation.\u201d Yet their\nresponse was wholly unorthodox. Unlike Snow\u2019s technocratic call to arms, which argued\nthat culture abdicate to modern science and which Kl\u00fcver and Rauschenberg ultimately\nopposed, E.A.T. posed a way to bring disparate fields together\u2014to create a \u201ccatalyst for\nthe inevitable fusing of specializations,\u201d as Rauschenberg put it.2 If artists and engineers\nactually talked to one another, shared information, broke out of professional\nspecializations, they might change one another, change their disciplines, change the\nstructure of invention itself. The gulf between art and technology might become a\ncontest, a rivalry, and a transformation.\nRauschenberg met Kl\u00fcver in 1960. The engineer was a high-level specialist in\nlasers and optics at AT&T Bell Laboratories, epicenter of the modern\ntelecommunications revolution. Born in Monaco, raised in Sweden, then receiving his\n2.

{"29": "Ph.D. in physics at Berkeley, Kl\u00fcver had unorthodox connections from the start. The\ncurator Pontus Hult\u00e9n, a friend and fellow Swede, had introduced Kl\u00fcver to the artist\nJean Tinguely, with whom he would work on Homage to New York, a kinetic sculpture\nthat self-destructed in the Sculpture Garden of The Museum of Modern Art in 1960. It\nwas there that the engineer encountered Rauschenberg, who had constructed the small,\ncoin-tossing sculpture Money Thrower for the event; they struck up a friendship, and\nKl\u00fcver subsequently helped Rauschenberg and a number of other artists with various\nelectrical or mechanical needs.

Once\nlit, neon lamps exhibit the characteristic of \u201cnegative resistance\u201d\u2014increasing the current\nflow through the device decreases the resistance of the lamp and allows even more\ncurrent to flow. To counteract this tendency, electrical circuitry external to the lamp must\nprovide a means to limit current flow through the circuit or else the current will rapidly\nincrease until the lamp is destroyed. If the current runs too low, however, the lamp will\nflicker and eventually die out. For lamps the size of the letters in Zone and Field\nPainting (approximately 8 inches long), a specially constructed voltage transformer is\nstretcher was used as a connecting wire to a 3,000 volt neon bulb.

These\nchanges in scale produced markedly different effects, ranging from the relative freedom\nof isolated movement to a claustrophobic crowding in which Clouds would fill the\nceiling.

Oracle\u2019s window of\nconstruction predates Silver Clouds by one year, but I would like to go back to this\nslightly earlier piece in order to chart major shifts occurring in Rauschenberg\u2019s own work\nin the mid-1960s, changes parallel to the experimentation with Silver Clouds and equally\ndivergent from the moment of Rauschenberg\u2019s White Paintings in 1951-53. For, after the\nartist met Kl\u00fcver in 1960 during the engineer\u2019s collaboration with Jean Tinguely,\nRauschenberg\u2019s continuing relationship with Kl\u00fcver was to redefine his practice through\nthe deployment of collaboration. In Oracle, the contact between engineers and artists\nmade possible an investigation of densely hybrid configurations of media and subjective\nexperience, a foray into what could be called the \u201ccybernetic\u201d conditions of forecasting\nand prediction.1\n1 This onset of Rauschenberg\u2019s so-called \u201ctechnological\u201d work should not be seen as a negative caesura, the\ndemise of the artist\u2019s aspirations toward difference and hybridity into works that promoted a na\u00efve, switch-\nlike determinacy of participation\u2014thereby inscribing the very spectacularity and instrumentality in the\naesthetic experience that the White Paintings and Combines had worked so hard to escape. Ironically,\nRauschenberg\u2019s \u201ctechnological\u201d work is simultaneously accused of not being spectacular enough, of being\ntoo technically simplistic and thus disappointing.

Black\u2019s work, for example, was part of a nexus of\nresearch at Bell that was subsequently furthered by Harry Nyquist, whose classical work\non the stability of feedback amplifiers yielded axioms pertaining to feedback control\ntheory, bandwidth requirements, and thermal noise, each instrumental for Shannon\u2019s\ninformation theory and the understanding of feedback and dynamic systems.27 While the\nbroader implications of control engineering research for the development of Experiments\nin Art and Technology will be discussed in the next chapters, I want to note here the ways\nin which Oracle can be understood as both firmly embedded within and yet keenly\ntroubling this discourse of cybernetics and servomechanisms\u2014of violence, information,\nand control.\nFor if cybernetics\u2014and the broad array of devices whose properties it defined\u2014\nwas predicated on the regulation and adjustment of dynamic systems, Oracle was a\nsystem that activated its own interruption or diversion.

Why, exactly, did Rauschenberg declare that \u201cpainting was the\nwrong form for [the radio system] to take\u201d?39 The answer, I think, is that Ace began one\ntrajectory in Rauschenberg\u2019s work, Oracle another. First, Oracle represented an\nexploration of actual, dynamic radio networks as opposed to the transmitted images of\ntelevision. Whereas Ace and Rauschenberg\u2019s subsequent works in silkscreen and paint\neffected a critique of televisual spectacle and the status of the screened image, as Joseph\nhas shown, Oracle mounted a systematic interrogation of the kinetic, acoustic, and\nprivatized space of the transistor radio. And to fully engage this dynamism of radio\ndemanded a sculptural and technologically specific investigation into how radio\ncontinually shifted and organized the space of reception.\n37 Ibid.\n38 As Joseph maintains, \u201cAce marks a departure for Rauschenberg, not only because it was flatter than most\nof his earlier work\u2014a feature emphasized by the broad, rectangular areas of light blue and green paint at\nthe right and, further, by the two cardboard boxes pressed flat against the surface of the canvas\u2014but also,\nand more important, because it attained a visual homogeneity that eliminates what he has called \u2018changes of\nfocus.\u2019 ...

This\nwould not mean a definitive abandonment of previous concerns in Combines but rather a\ndoubling, a mutual imbrication, of pursuits. In a passage from Random Order cited by\nKrauss, Rauschenberg had reproduced close-ups of stairs and their risers, noting the\nthree-dimensional articulation of a stairwell, \u201ca sculptural masterpiece clearly,\neconomically and dramatically defining space.\u201d42 It is striking, then, that in Oracle,\nRauschenberg chose the small staircase to house the control system; he intended for\n40 Rosalind Krauss, \u201cPerpetual Inventory\u201d (1997), Robert Rauschenberg, ed.

Such a\nconception was already presaged in Cage\u2019s first piece to incorporate radio, Imaginary\nLandscape No. 4 (1951).

{"92": "Oracle extends the active role of the \u201cperformer\u201d to any and all passerby.52 It impedes\nthe direct relationship between the body, mechanical controls, and tuning/volume output;\nand, most important, it embeds the radio system in resolutely heavy, lumbering,\nsculptural form. Building on Cage\u2019s work and yet surpassing certain of its assumptions,\nOracle confronted the ways in which radio\u2019s plenary diversity was also a sophisticated\nrealization of the customization of capital and the privatization of networks, spaces, and\nthings. This was not an unimpeded ether, \u201cfree for an infinite play of interpenetration,\u201d\nbut an uneven and irregular realm of discrete pockets and aporias.\nOracle realized seminal aspects of what McLuhan termed radio\u2019s \u201cacoustic\nspace\u201d\u2014a realm that did not posit geometrical spatial relations, that possessed neither\ncenter or periphery, since hearing occurs from all directions simultaneously.53 With\nLandscape #4\u201d (1951), in which twelve radios were \u2018played\u2019 by twenty-four performers.\u201d Joseph, Random\nOrder, 185.\n52 In this sense, Oracle also departs from another earlier, related work, George Brecht\u2019s event score Candle\nPiece for Radios (1959), which was likely written as \u201chomework\u201d for John Cage\u2019s class in experimental\ncomposition at the New School and derived from the latter\u2019s Imaginary Landscape No. 4. Brecht\u2019s piece\ndirects performers to manipulate the volume and tuning dials of a set number of radios according to specific\ndirections distributed on instruction cards. When a performer drew a card, he would follow those\ninstructions as to the precise direction and amount to turn the volume and tuning dials on a radio; the\nnumerical values of each adjustment were determined by a table of random numbers. Even Brecht,\nhowever, admitted that this system of instructions seemed overdetermined, and that it involved too many\ninstruction cards; this type of extensive performative instruction and controlled environment seems at odds\nwith the parameters of Oracle.

Against the linear, fragmented order of vision and the\nprinted word, McLuhan proposed that acoustic space defined the nodal, relational, and decentered network\nof electronic communications. See Marshall McLuhan, The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of\nTypographic Man (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1962). The notion of an aural (and non-visual)\nordering of space also developed in the discourse on film sound, most notably by Christian Metz in his\nseminal essay \u201cAural Objects\u201d. As Metz wrote, the \u201cspatial anchoring of aural events is much more vague\nand uncertain than that of visual events.

Whether in the form of a catastrophic\nblackout or noise surrounding an electrical signal, uncertainty was unavoidable. But it\nwas also subject to newly developed tools of management. Each piece in 9 Evenings,\nwhether using oscilloscopes or the custom wireless system devised for the festival, relied\nupon this regulation of signals and their concomitant noise.

There were about 2,500 people out there chafing at the bit and\nnothing worked. It was pretty crucial and I remember there was a lot of suppressed tearing of hair and\nHartig (the man in charge of the infrared TV for Rauschenberg) went around and pulled all the plugs out of\nthe current supplies, took some snippers and cut the ground pole off each plug servicing the projectors,\nturned the plug around and plugged it back in. That\u2019s all it took and everything was on. It was as dumb as\nthat. Very complex equipment but it was just like turning around the plug on a toaster\u2026. I also remember\nsomeone telling Rauschenberg that he had to go upstairs and start mixing his imagery. He said, \u2018Oh, my\nGod!\u2019 He hadn\u2019t thought of that, hadn\u2019t done it before, and hadn\u2019t had time to rehearse or anything else.\nHis famous quote is, \u2018I\u2019ll think of something,\u2019 which seemed pretty cool for a guy who was putting together\nsuch an elaborate piece. I remember another thing about Rauschenberg\u2019s piece. It seems to me we were\nvery moved up on the balcony. I remember some tears going around. It was a very moving piece for some\nreason\u2014unembarrassedly so. There was Les Levine, John Giorno, myself and Rauschenberg up on the\nbalcony. And Hartig was there. In the first performance everybody repeated their names in the dark and\nthey blew the tape. \u2026Who knew that everytime they hit the tennis ball it would turn lights out. Obviously,\nthe comment there was you could do the whole thing with switches. The technology thing is always up for\ngrabs in things like that. How complicated it is is in the background, people lose their sense of proportion\nthat way. The dramatic effect was the same, automatic or not. Those are those little victories and deceits.\nUnheralded I guess. I just remember being moved by that first time around. All those people announcing\ntheir names was a little bit like \u2018Our Town.\u2019 We were all so grateful that the thing finally did work\u2026. We\ncouldn\u2019t see what the audience was seeing.

The switch has been wired backwards so the whole first performance is run with me\nplugging in a screwdriver to shorten the contact point in the switch in the proper order. \u2026 By the second\nperformance everything has been tried out and the whole thing is beautiful but the first night was a\nnightmare.

But, in fact, the funding program for E.A.T. directly reflected\nRauschenberg\u2019s own extraordinary experimentation with models of funding. If\nRauschenberg himself initially put up funds for the organization, this was in keeping with\nhis exploration of unorthodox patronage structures and posing of alternatives to the\ncommercial gallery, often financially supporting projects himself.\nAnd if the expenditures were great, the risk incurred was greater: a deficit of\n$50,000 remained after the performances, surely making this a bad, or at least\nspeculative, investment if ever there was one. Gorewitz and attorney Franklin\nKonigsberg attempted to fundraise to cover these remaining costs. Rauschenberg put up\n$100,000 worth of paintings as collateral. Again, the FCPA was ultimately responsible\nfor the majority of debt relief.\nAfter 9 Evenings, Kl\u00fcver and Rauschenberg launched a benefit exhibition at\nCastelli from December 6-10, 1966 (organized by Alex Hay and Lucinda Childs, and\nwith artists from Arakawa to Sturtevant, Oldenburg to Brion Gysin, donating artworks for\nsale) to begin fundraising for E.A.T. itself.

The National Endowment for the Arts had just been\nfounded in 1964 and the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1965, for example.\nAs a result, artists would spend almost as much time writing grant proposals as making\nart. But the founders of E.A.T. never intended for the organization to operate under the\naegis of a governmental or academic institution. This sharply contrasted with virtually\nevery other art and technology venture at the time. E.A.T.\u2019s structure was markedly\ndistinct from Zero, for example, whose practice would find its ultimate home in the\nuniversity, at Kepes\u2019s and Piene\u2019s CAVS program at MIT. Nor did E.A.T. want museum\nexhibitions to be their primary mode of reception. This ran counter to finite museum\nendeavors such as LACMA\u2019s \u201cArt and Technology\u201d show, in which institutional\ndisplay\u2014the single exhibition\u2014was the end result of collaborative activity.\nIn short, neither E.A.T.\u2019s financial nor its structural status fit into known models\nfor arts patronage, administration, or museological display. And this is why E.A.T.\ncannot entirely be defined in terms of the critique\u2014or affirmation\u2014of institutions. For\nsuch critique historically depended on the definition of institutions, from the museum to\nthe very concept of modernism, as synonymous with the static, disciplinary strictures of\nscientific positivism. As Benjamin H. D. Buchloh has argued in his watershed reading of\nConceptual art, modernist empiricism originated in nineteenth-century scientific\npositivism\u2014and therefore in technological rationality, the \u201cfounding logic of capitalism\u201d;\n29 E.A.T.

Yet even as\nit included many of these artists as members, E.A.T. departs from the Conceptual project.\nOn the one hand, E.A.T. could be seen to have pushed the \u201caesthetics of administration\u201d\nto its very limit\u2014to a degree of imbrication and extension in structures of technological\nrationality wholly unmatched in postwar art. On the other hand, E.A.T. faced a different\ntechno-scientific regime: a condition that could no longer be characterized by older\nmodels of administration, positivism, rationality, and bureaucracy, nor by an older logic\nof capitalism. Instead, E.A.T. broached new, shifting realms of reason, scientific method,\ntechnological invention, and aesthetic, organizational, and economic systems. It reflected\nand confronted another world.\nIn this, E.A.T. shares some of the affirmative character of Pop and Minimalism,\nnot to mention that of Cage. Yet affirmation and mimesis were not the only implications\nof these movements. Nor was critical negation the only implication of Conceptualism.\nOther scenarios were posed, most significantly for their modeling of nascent fields of\ncontrol\u2014fields that differed from modernist institutions of sovereign power and positivist\nreason because of their flexibility, their atomization, their multiplicity.31 So while E.A.T.\n30 Buchloh, \u201cConceptual Art 1962-1969: From the Critique of Institutions to the Aesthetics of\nAdministration,\u201d 115.

Even as it attempts to cater to an audience that might not\nbe familiar with contemporary art, making its case to appeal to the practical aims of\nengineers, the lecture is bracing, highly contradictory, ranging from quantum mechanics\nto Susan Sontag\u2019s \u201cOn Style.\u201d\nAppropriately enough, Kl\u00fcver begins with interaction: with the exciting\ndevelopments in contemporary art and its \u201ctransgression into different forms,\u201d briefly\nciting Happenings and 9 Evenings as two examples of such intermedial contravention.\nAnd transgression across different boundaries is intimately linked to the topic of the\nfuture. An \u201cartist friend\u201d told him, he says, that people have two things on their mind\nwhen they think about the future: technology and drugs. With this quintessentially\ncountercultural combination, then, Kl\u00fcver begins a meditation on experience and\nsociological interaction. If Cage had said that \u201ctechnology breeds agreement,\u201d drugs\nmake it \u201cunnecessary to have agreements.\u201d One is active, outward; the other is passive,\ninwardly directed. One is interactive, the other solipsistic.

The contemporary artist\u2019s involvement or desire to\nbe involved with technology signifies his wish to be involved with society.\u201d The future,\nfor Kl\u00fcver, would be predicated on interaction\u2014interaction between ever-evolving and\ncurrently distant domains.\n132"}
{"159": "Referring to the legacy of \u201cAristotle, Leonardo, Van Eyck, the Futurists, the\nConstructivists, Schwitters, and the Bauhaus movement\u201d as precursors of an interaction\nbetween art and technology, Kl\u00fcver argues that these historical precedents relegated\ntechnology to a passive role. It is only with the modern intervention of Duchamp, Cage,\nand Johns, he says, that technology might be allowed agency\u2014that the arbitrary,\nsubjective, bourgeois, \u201ctraditional values\u201d of art be consigned to the dustbin. \u201cDuchamps\n[sic] suggested that the vector space that forms the world of the artist must never be\nexperienced as a complete set. The artist must be conscious of the process of being an\nartist and hence of his own unawareness, of his not-knowing. \u2026 The meaning of art is\nnot to communicate what we already know but what we don\u2019t know, to dislocate our\nvision, to make us look \u2026 Art is not a comment on or a criticism of the world.\u201d He then\nquotes Sontag: \u201c\u2019A work of art cannot advocate anything at all\u2019\u201d; and the legendary\nphysicist Paul Dirac, who \u201cinsists on the measurable, observable reality rather than the\nvalidity of abstract mathematical concepts. Dirac has been to physics what Duchamps\n[sic] has been to art.\u201d\nAbove all, this is a form of realism: a desire to \u201cenjoy the complexity of the\nworld rather than be terrified by it.\u201d And this openness to complexity and contingency,\nobviously informed by Cage, is also a kind of materialism or immanence. Art is not there\nto \u201cmake order out of chaos\u201d; rather, as Kl\u00fcver quotes Sontag: \u201c\u2019Art is not only about\nsomething, it is something. A work of art is a thing in the world, not just a text or\ncommentary on the world.\u2019\u201d Apart from metaphysics, knowledge, moral judgment, or\n\u201ctraditional values,\u201d art is \u201csomething like an excitation.\u201d\n133"}

Moreover, \u201cThe contemporary artist\nwants the engineer. The contemporary artist sees the engineer as his collaborator, his\nmaterial and his inspiration.\u201d Articulating an idea that he will repeat throughout the\nhistory of E.A.T., Kl\u00fcver refers to the engineer himself as a material: the coming\ntogether of these vastly different spheres of experience, knowledge, perception, and\nrepresentation means nothing less than an upending of subject-object distinctions.\nWhat does this mean for actual interactions between artists and engineers?\nKl\u00fcver is adamant that industry be financially and logistically responsible; that new\ntechnology be prioritized (so that the artist \u201cmay catch up\u201d).

The \u2018reader\u2019 will actually never know if he has read all of the\nmaterial the poet programmed.\u201d\nThis extraordinary riff presages the explosion of literacy, reading, information, size, and\nthe notion of a bottomless storage device for discourse and interaction: a scenario that\nforetells the seeming endlessness of information proffered by contemporary apparatuses,\nbut that also outlines a strangely abstract, alternate path, one that stands apart from the\ndiscrete and certain exchanges of the iPad tablet or hypertext markup language.\nWhat are the dangers of such interactions?

Much the same division of labor had been outlined in Kl\u00fcver\u2019s\n\u201cInterface\u201d lecture. But by the time of the second issue, the interaction was not to be\nconfined to the industrial laboratory. Instead, it would be unprecedented in scope and\nimpact: \u201cThe collaboration of artist and engineer emerges as a revolutionary\ncontemporary sociological process. \u2026 E.A.T. will act as a \u2018matching agency\u2019 where an\nartist with a problem is matched to a member engineer whose qualifications are such that\nhe understands what the artist is talking about.\u201d\nThe complete articulation of the \u201cmatching agency\u201d strategy thus coincided with\nthe major effort to attract member engineers, on the one hand, and serious attempts to\nforge relationships with industrial management. Perhaps most exciting was the\nannouncement that the matchings had begun: 35 artists had been connected to 20\nengineers. Tear-out sheets in the newsletter were to function as basic questionnaires that\ncould be filled out and sent back as forms for matching [Figs. 3.7, 3.8].\nThe success of the matchings was not predicated on their stability but on their\nevaporation. If effective, such mediation would no longer be needed: \u201cOnce it has\nachieved the change in the cultural and industrial climate so that industry can assume a\nmore direct responsibility for the sponsorship of the artist-engineer collaboration, the\nfunction of E.A.T. as a mediator may well disappear.\u201d67 And crucial to such thorough\npermeation and expansive scale were the flexibility and openness E.A.T. hoped to\n67 Ibid.\n140"}

Our\n\u2018underground\u2019 of engineers is just as important as the positive attitude of top level\nmanagement.\u201d In other words, the effort to reach engineers coincided with recognition of\nthe need to build a network from the \u201cunderground\u201d up, through all levels of\nmanagement, across the industrial sector; and this de-hierarchization would be\nfundamental to the very definition of the organization, its plasticity.

I knew what I wanted and it was\nsimply a matter of finding someone to build it. This approach changed in\nproportion to what I found out about how things got made. It became less and\nless a matter of being in a studio thinking of things, making the plans and sending\nthem off to the fabricator. More and more it became a matter of incorporating\nmethods and materials I had found out about in the process of being related to\nparticular fabricators. The process of working became more direct and also more\ncomplex\u2014involving as it would not only the ever increasing acquisition of\ntechnical information but also the development of a social and executive sense\nwhich had not been necessary when I made the work myself in the studio.\u201d78\nIn other words, instead of less interaction with material or informational process\u2014the\nartist as conceptual ideator, merely placing an order for fabrication\u2014the artist himself\nbegins to absorb the knowledge, the technical information, the skill, as well as the\nexecutive, social, and organizational habitus, bringing all of these complex processes\nback into his or her own orbit. Working becomes more \u201cextended,\u201d and more open-\nended:\n\u201cWorking became a very extended situation of making appointments, visiting\nfactories and gathering information. The more I found out and the more people I\nmet who were interested in helping, the less it seemed necessary to plan\neverything either precisely or completely in advance. More work got made easier\nby leaving certain problems open for others to work out. I began accepting\nsolutions suggested by others which showed up in the finished work in very\nspecific ways\u2014and in ways which I had not preconceived. More possibilities\noccurred.

{"173": "The statement is stunning: work becomes ever so slightly more corporate, which\naccompanies less control, not more. \u201cCorporate\u201d does not imply top-down administrative\ncontrol; here \u201ccorporate\u201d actually means flexibility, more possibilities, more openness,\nmore surprise. Morris continues: \u201cWhat is interesting to me about E.A.T. is that it seems\nto be a pretty maximum resource for a much more extended kind of corporate making\u2026\u201d\nUnlike his own previous practice and even that of Nine Evenings, where the individual\nartist still seems to possess a kind of traditional control,\n\u201cI think this type of product control is being questioned by younger people\u2026I\nthink the broader awareness and more extended involvement in social, political as\nwell as artistic action indicates a less professionalistic, less specialist, less\nproduct-oriented tendency. Possibly these people will be able to utilize the\nfacilities E.A.T. offers for a more extended way of working which involves the\ncooperation and initiative of many. But if this is true, I do not know what is\npossible in these new terms. It would be boring to try to predict its nature. It\nwould seem that getting many unlikely things tried would be more relevant than\ndemanding particular successes.\nI hope E.A.T. can maintain and develop roots in many extended processes\nand connect to many diverse people. By being open, available and diverse, it will\nbe a means that has not existed before. Out of such means, things we cannot\npredict should develop.\u201d79\nMorris articulates a future one could not predict\u2014an E.A.T. that is \u201copen,\navailable, and diverse.\u201d From one vantage, this openness, diversity, and unpredictability\ngenerates a vortex of contradictions: the seemingly paradoxical conjunction of \u201cmore\u201d\n79 Ibid. Emphasis added. This testimony goes slightly against the grain of Morris\u2019s other writings at the\ntime\u2014specifically, his articulation of \u201ccontrol\u201d in his \u201cNotes on Sculpture\u201d essays of 1966: \u201cControl is\nnecessary if the variables\u2026are to function,\u201d Morris argued, in contrast to his fascination with a certain lack\nof control in the E.A.T. text. See Morris, \u201cNotes on Sculpture, Part II,\u201d Artforum V, no. 2 (October 1966):\n23; reprinted in Minimal Art: A Critical Anthology, ed. Gregory Battcock (New York: E.P. Dutton, 1968),\n234. The discrepancy evinces a certain anxiety with regard to E.A.T. in relation to his own work and\nrelations of power, an anxiety that lends a different inflection to the fraught overlap (or, in Foster\u2019s words,\n\u201ccrux\u201d) between Minimalism and Conceptual art.

All became linkages that were themselves linked in the network of networks of the\norganizational complex. \u2026 Again, we are confronted here with a situation of control through feedback.\nOrganization, as a means of control, is necessarily a function of the various nodes through which its forces\nflow. And architecture, as one constitutive node among many in the network, acts as both receiver and\ntransmitter of patterned organizational codes, thereby gaining its status as one among many technologies of\norganization.\u201d Martin, The Organizational Complex, 214-215. In another register, Cage had articulated the\nconvergence of order and disorder in a kind of transparent equilibrium\u2014precisely through the organic:\n\u201cWhere there\u2019s a history of organization (art), introduce disorder. Where there\u2019s a history of\ndisorganization (world society), introduce order. \u2026 We need for instance an utterly wireless technology.\nJust as Fuller domes (dome within dome, translucent, plants between) will give impression of living in no\nhome at all (outdoors), so all technology must move toward way things were before man began changing\nthem: identification with nature in her manner of operation, complete mystery.\u201d John Cage, \u201cDiary: How\nto Improve the World (You Will Only Make Matters Worse) 1965,\u201d A Year From Monday: New Lectures\nand Writings (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1967), 3-21; see also Aspen 4 (Spring 1967).\nIndeed, much of the \u201cDiary\u201d essay stemmed from Cage\u2019s interchanges with Kl\u00fcver about communication\nsystems, wireless networks, technology, and organization.

That economy is one of the\ncharacteristics of the system of information storing and retrieving which we call the General Practitioner\u2026\nThe limitations of conventional filing systems do not occur in our method of handling information.\nEdgenotched cards, the physical components, are not new. They have been around for forty years and are\navailable from several companies. What is new is what we do with them. The General Practitioner is a\nsystem tailored to work in many individual and small group uses. \u2026 The investment required to start a\nsystem is small. Equipment includes only cards, stiff rods (like knitting needles), a punch or other notching\ndevice, and a list of punch codes\u2026For [those]\u2026with easy access to the computer and sufficient funds to\nuse it, the General Practitioner may be of small interest. There are other sophisticated devices on the\nmarket for storing and retrieving information. The major advantages of the General Practitioner over such\nsystems employing business machines are that it is cheap and compact\u2026 All cards have holes around the\nedge, differentiating them from the more commonly seen cards that are machine-punched through the body.\nThink of utility bills or those cards labeled Do Not Bend Spindle or Mutilate that banks and universities\nand companies are always handing you: those are machine-punched cards. With edgenotched cards, only\nthe borders of the card are used for retrieval operations, while the body of the card is left for you to record\ninformation on. On the body of the card you can write, type, draw, Xerox, stamp, staple of glue small\nphotographs, negatives or clippings.\u201d The instructions go on to enumerate salient features: Each card has a\ndogeared corner, so that when they are stacked, you can see at a glance the orientation of the card; a \u201cdeck\u201d\nis a collection of cards that you keep together; a \u201csubdeck\u201d is part of a deck.

It was also a kind of social\nnetwork, as outlined in the group\u2019s proposal:\n\u201cE.A.T. proposes to develop software for a computer-based program to compile a\ndirectory in the area of art and technology. The directory will be comprised of\nalphabetical listings of artists, engineers, scientists, other professionals,\ninformation resources, industries, professional conferences, equipment\nexhibitions, etc. and retrieval indexes. The directory will be produced in book\nform by offset printing directly from the computer printout.\nAlthough the development of the software for the program is in itself\nstraightforward, gathering, correcting and assessing the effectiveness and\nusefulness of the information content requires considerable testing and feedback\nfrom participating individuals. The principal feature of the program is a permuted\nsubject word index describing the technical skills, competence, interests and\nactivities of the participating individuals listed in the directory. Another\nimportant feature is that once the initial program has been written and tested, the\ninformation printed in the directory can be easily updated and extended.\u201d149\n147 Here I refer to Heidegger\u2019s reading of the difference between typewriting and handwriting in his lecture\non Parmenides.

According to the same axioms, television\nand the semiconductor operate by decomposing and remaking a field to achieve optimum patterns of\ncirculation. Both intensify distribution flows while at the same time imposing intricate circuitries of\ncontrol.\u201d Ibid., 293.

In today\u2019s technological\nmilieu that threatens to destroy human life and values, we desparetly [sic] need\nimaginative alternatives, but flying machines have existed in our collective\nstorehouse of fantasy for centuries (e.g., see the recent exhibit The Machine by\nthe New York Museum of Modern Art). If engineers and technicians need new\ngrist for their mills (and I seriously believe they do) then why do artists continue\nto be obsessed with symbols or metaphors that are well known and explored?\nTheir chief value to the human race has always been in their function to be the\nprecursors of consciousness. I suggest that a proper use of imagination would be\nto turn to what we can hope to receive from the future\u2014not to what we already\nknow of the past.\u201d219\nFinally, according to John Pruner of the major aerospace think tank Lawrence Livermore\nLaboratories,\n\u201c\u2026Mr. Panamarenko\u2019s design concept is basically feasible and is not without\nprecedent.

{"229": "technological resources and sophistication needed to engineer a project such as\nPanamarenko\u2019s was hopelessly out of reach. For Panamarenko, who had turned from\nproto-Conceptual assemblages in the 1960s to the dirigibles that would consume the rest\nof his career, the design problem of the personal flying vehicle was in and of itself an\nongoing investigation that need not be fulfilled, or work. After correspondence with\nPoole and these engineers, Panamarenko would go on to attempt to implement some\naspects of Pruner\u2019s recommendations, producing highly complex blueprints and designs;\nbut he would never successfully produce a personal, wingless flying device of this\nscale.221 His interaction with E.A.T. attested to the endlessness of his project\u2014an\nopenness and infinitude that could not have been more different from the scientistic\npositivism of Buckminster Fuller\u2019s breathlessly optimistic schemes.222 If Fuller made\nengineering utopian, Panamarenko made it weird.\nEngineering took another turn in Hans Haacke\u2019s Photo-Electric Viewer-\nControlled Coordinate System, 1968 [Figs. 3.47, 3.48]. First shown at Howard Wise\nGalllery, the work comprised a full floor-to-ceiling grid of infrared beams; viewers\u2019\nmovements would trigger photo-sensors that would control incandescent light bulbs\narrayed in a row at mid-level. In the beginning, in 1967, Haacke had written to E.A.T.\nwith a membership form and proposal for a \u201cPhoto-electrically sensitized \u2018environment\u201d\nfor a solo show in January 1968 at Howard Wise Gallery [Fig. 3.49]:\n\u201cA dark, square room, 13 feet long and 13 feet wide, with an entrance, that\nequally serves as exit, of approximately 2 feet, in one corner.

On two adjoining walls, equally at intervals\nof 1 ft., but slightly lower, i.e. at approximately chest level, infra-red photo-relays\nwill be situated. On the opposite two adjoining walls will be the complimentary\nprojectors. Twenty-four infra-red projectors and 24 relays are needed. It is\nimportant that these projectors emit only invisible light, and it is also desirable\nthat the relays be silent in their operation. The incandescent bulbs are connected\nwith the relays in such a way that, whenever the projector-relay infra-red light\nbeam is interrupted, the bulbs directly above these respective pieces of equipment\nlight up immediately. Assuming that a person in this room under normal\ncircumstances breaks two beams (perpendicular to each other), four bulbs will\nlight up at once, one on each of the four walls. If there is more than one person in\nthe room, more lights will be on, four lights for each person. Thus the number of\npersons in the room determines the degree of illumination. The gallery has A.C.\ncurrent, with numerous outlets, each with a separate 15 amp.

The viewer was never quite sure of the chain of reactions\nor events\u2014as if the work was enacting the nonlinearity and contingency of technology\nitself.226 The responsive system highlights the distinction between system and\nenvironment, self-reference and external reference, a system of interdependent processes\nrather than a discrete object. This immanent understanding of the system diverged from\nBurnham\u2019s early analysis of Haacke\u2019s work, which ultimately veered into a utopian\nnotion of interactivity and autonomy. (And the tension between these viewpoints would\ngrow as Burnham and Haacke\u2019s own notions of systems and the art-technology\nrelationship would change\u2014and grow into disillusionment\u2014over time.) \u201cA system is\nnot imagined, it is real,\u201d Haacke wrote.227\nPhoto-Electric System maximized illumination depending on the number of\nbodies in the room.

All the artists were interested and turned up on\nTuesday to talk with Richard Decker, the engineer in charge of the project, and Ed\nWebb, a physicist and engineer who will be the collaborator working with the\nartist.\nDecker and Webb were much impressed by all of the artists, as were the\nartists by them. The Singer people had in fact been so impressed that they\nforesaw great difficulty in making up their minds. They have since done so and\nnotified me that Bochner was their man.\u201d247\nThe facilities at Singer were cutting-edge, with nascent computer scanning and graphics\ncapabilities:\n\u201cThe equipment is available at the laboratory to scan a two-dimensional artistic\nrendition in color and convert to computer language.

{"239": "Most of Bochner\u2019s time was spent in conversations with staff, which he recorded\nin a notebook every day; these conversations centered on how to communicate\nexperience and information, and thus quantification. Bochner would create a Xerox book\nof these thoughts, titled The Singer Notes (1968).250 In it, the artist details ideas for\nfeeding numbers into a computer that would generate permutations of those numbers and\nprint them out as photographs. And yet, as Bochner later recounted, the programmers\ncould not write a program that would perform these operations fast enough\u2014it would be\nmuch more convenient to simply do them by hand. Ironically, as the Singer press release\nhad stated, the facilities existed to perform the inverse operation: to convert a color\nphotograph into \u201ccomputer language,\u201d FORTRAN. It was in this sense that Bochner\ncould entertain the question of conversion from image to information: from photography\nto digital code, from index to symbol, and vice versa, thus figuring the loss of\nindexicality from photographic ontology. As Bochner states,\n\u201cI was very fortunate through EAT to get the opportunity to work at the Singer\nlabs, which were out in New Jersey, and I think Singer, which had diversified\nfrom sewing machines, felt some competition with AT&T because they were both\ninto all kinds of aero space things, at that point. They thought it might be\ninteresting to have an artist come out and do work in a think tank situation with\nthe scientists and engineers there. And basically it was about three months, two\ndays a week, of just sitting around and talking with these guys and trying to find\nsomething to talk about. What we might have in common, what we might\ndisagree with, what points on which our interests might overlap. this is what they\ndid for a living, what they did every day. It was research and development,\nbrainstorming new things for the company to produce, sitting around the table,\nscribbling notes to themselves. So, right from the very first day, I started saving\nevery scrap of paper. I\u2019d gone out there with a few ideas for actual projects, none\nof which panned out.\u201d251\n250 Mel Bochner, The Singer Notes (1968).

{"240": "\u201cOne idea,\u201d Bochner notes, \u201cwas to find a way to use their high-powered computers to\ntranslate some of my number drawings directly into photographic images. But in those\ndays you couldn't type directly into a computer; everything had to be translated into a\nprogramming language called FORTRAN. The programmer said it would take him six\nmonths to write the program, making it faster for me to do it by hand. So much for\ncomputer-generated images in 1968!\u201d252\nBochner still, however, pursued technological media that he could not have tested\notherwise. As the Singer Notes detail, Bochner was interested in the conversion of color\nto \u201cdigital output,\u201d whether using scanning, another newly evolving technology, or a\nvector graphic system (vector graphics, in which shapes are defined by mathematical\ncurves, are one basis for digital graphics today) [Fig. 3.52].253 Bochner headlined the\nsheet with the mandate: \u201cQUALITY TO QUANTITY TRANSDUCTION.\u201d And so\nqualitative to quantitative became, for Bochner, a way of investigating the conversion of\nmaterial to information, or visual perception to numbers. While the computers could not\nactually handle the quantity of data at stake, Bochner played with video and photography.\nBochner seemed to outline one such experiment in his notes as another transduction:\n\u201cTELEVISION IMAGE TO PHOTO IMAGE / TRANSDUCTION.\u201d The artist set up a\nvideo feed of four wooden blocks arrayed on a grid, then toggled the vertical hold setting\nof the video camera, creating a stuttering and blurring image on the monitor. He\nphotographed the monitor, creating eight gelatin silver prints titled Roll (1968), which, at\n20 x 24 inches each, the curved frame of the monitor set into each picture, served as\n252 Mel Bochner, \u201cMedia Study,\u201d Artforum International 51, no. 1 (September 2012): 463.\n253 Bochner, Singer Notes, n.p.\n214"}

Four years before Joan Jonas\u2019s\nseminal Vertical Roll would underscore the groundlessness of video, its irreducibility to a\nspecific medium, Bochner\u2019s Roll captures the total instability and contingency of media\ntransmission and reproduction.\nFinally, toward the end of his residency, Bochner began measuring things. First,\nBochner had Singer staffers themselves take Polaroids of the scenarios. Then he\nrephotographed the Polaroids, cropped them, and had the negatives developed as 8 x 10\ngelatin silver prints. In the pictures, mundane objects are shown scattered throughout the\noffice and lab. Black Letraset numbers and black tape mark off distances. Bochner\ndescribes the work as a manifestation of the failure of objective quantification and\ncommunication:\n\u201cI saved all of the notes and papers and doodles that we wrote while we were\nsitting around, and I turned those into a book called The Singer Notes, and as time\nwent on, the subject came to be objectification, how to communicate, and how to\ncommunicate objectively.

If they didn\u2019t have a\nmeasurement, and it wasn\u2019t repeatable, then it wasn\u2019t trustworthy, and there was\nno communication. So at a certain point I had this idea I would come in early one\nday with some Letraset, and I randomly put different measurements around the\nlab. Not attached to anything. Just free floating on walls on doors on the floor. I\ndidn\u2019t tell anybody about it, I secretly went around. And they came in and\ndiscovered those, and of course that lead to a new round of questions, what does\nthis mean, how do you divorce measurement from an object, etcetera etcetera, led\n254 Skrebowski persuasively reads Roll as an emblem of the ways in which analog photography itself was\nalways already unmoored from the real: \u201cIn lieu of producing his proto-digital photographs, Bochner\nfocused on the \u2018phantoms\u2019 that haunted analogue visual media.\u201d Skrebowski, \u201cProductive\nMisunderstandings,\u201d 130-131.\n215"}
{"242": "to some really interesting conversation. And then I asked the in house\nphotographer to take some photographs of these, which he did, as\ndocumentation.\u201d255\nIndeed, it was only after looking at these 8 x 10 photos that Bochner realized that the\nmeasurements indicated within the image had absolutely no relationship to the distance\nthey marked on the print.\n\u201c[A]s I looked through this stack of photographs, I began to realize that here you\nhave a measurement written on something that purports to say what it is -- but in\nthe illusion of the photograph it\u2019s represented as something else. So twelve\ninches equals three inches, but how do you pull that information out? There was\nno way to know the actual size of the object in the photograph.\u201d256\nThis recognition spawned Bochner\u2019s \u201cMeasurements\u201d series, which would\ncontinue well after his residency at Singer. But the project also spurred the fundamental\nrealization that measurements do not simply denote actual distances: the two sit in an\nuneasy relation. As Scott Rothkopf has shown, the markings in Bochner\u2019s photographs\ndo not measure distances between things, as we normally use measurement; instead, they\nseem to hover between \u201carbitrary physical points.\u201d257 (Even in a photo with a span\nbetween a spray can and wall molding, the mark does not totally line up with the can,\nbecause of the angle of the photograph and its perspectival distortion.) In this way, the\nessential scalelessness of photography becomes startlingly explicit: in the spray can\nphoto, for example, \u201cten inches\u201d depicted is less than five in the actual print [Fig. 3.54].\nThis \u201ccleaves an a priori concept from the physical world it is meant to describe\u201d; it\n255 Mel Bochner, interview with the author, April 26, 2013.\n256 Mel Bochner, interview with the author, April 26, 2013.\n257 Rothkopf, \u201c\u2018Photography cannot record abstract ideas\u2019 and other misunderstandings,\u201d 35.\n216"}

And that\u2019s what led to the pieces Actual Size (Face) and Actual Size\n(Hand), both 1968, where I put a twelve-inch measurement on the wall, stood next to it,\ntook a face shot, took a hand shot, and then had the photograph printed so that the\nmeasurement was actual size in the print.

By doing that the photograph became the index of the index, or a vicious circle.\nThat, for me, was the end of photography.\u201d260\nBochner was exploring the transformation from one media to another, and more\nimportantly, from one set of quantifications to another. From actual measurement to its\nphotographic representation. And the end of photography, for Bochner, led him to \u201cstart\nthinking about real space as opposed to what seemed to be the representation of space.\u201d261\nWhich, in turn, led from photography into architectural space, to the Measurement\n258 Rothkopf, \u201c\u2018Photography cannot record abstract ideas\u2019 and other misunderstandings,\u201d 38.

Of course, once\nyou put the measurements of a gallery, or any space, on the walls as a sort of three-\ndimensional blueprint, you realize that it's still a form of representation.

At this point my concerns began evolving in a more phenomenological direction\n...\u201d263\nThe Measurement series were not simply about visual or spatial mediation.\nAccording to Bochner, the conversations with Webb and the other scientists were what\nreally constituted the work. The photographs are investigations of the different kinds of\nnarratives or discourses at play in art and technology: two kinds of language.\nThey also function as a kind of documentation of a specific environment, the\nvisual language of the laboratory: the Letraset, the linoleum floors and spare\narchitecture, the mundane office supplies. In this sense, the media forms of 1960s\nindustrial research are likened to that of photography\u2014to the entropic nature of\ncommunication, whether technological, scientific, or aesthetic. And, of course,\nphotography is what traditionally brought these discourses of art and technology together\nin the modernist era. Photography itself was predicated on the contingency of\ntransduction, conversion, of slowness, incommensurability. As Bochner states,\n\u201cWith photography you have the lab, the waiting times.

But it was\nalso very different from the attitude of Conceptual artists, who treated the camera as a\nmere documentary device, as a way to dematerialize, to eliminate mediation (in favor of\nthe supposed transparency of linguistic or photographic signs).265 Bochner instead\n\u201cexplores the relationship between literal and representational, a relation he could not\nescape in photography itself\u2014and realizes that photography could not communicate ideas\nany more transparently than painting, or sculpture, or language itself.\u201d266\nAnd yet the Singer Notes also reveal something else about photography, apart\nfrom the realms of real and referent, or Minimalism or Conceptual art. Bochner was not\nonly exploring traditional photographic mediation, he was exploring the utterly new\nrelationship between material and code, between photography and the digital.267 The\nMeasurement pieces do not only mark the loss of indexicality, but point to the nascent\nredefinition of photography as a digital medium, as a medium of information, and of\nconversion between signal and noise, recognizing right from the start that this conversion\nwas never seamless or complete.\nThe question of analog-to-digital conversion and measurement was, in fact,\nforemost on the minds of Webb and the engineers at Singer.

The letters keep\ncoming and telephone lines are always busy. Now we are at a point where we can\nactually sit down and say, \u2018OK, we\u2019ve got all this interest of at least 20,000\npeople who know about EAT., what shall we do?\u2019 We get interest from\nuniversities, engineering societies, national science foundation, and even\nscientific establishments. Of course the art world is where it all comes from. But\nwe never thought we would get involved with the universities.\nWe still have the same problems however\u2026I believe the more eloquent\nand interesting way of solving this would be to establish a national organization\nwhere we have full-fledged E.A.T. groups using our name, tax exemption, what\nhave you, in the various cities (about five or six) across the United States. They\ncould be associated groups, not so formalized in other areas. There are of course\nother groups who are interested in the same subject that might want to be\nassociated with us. So, I think that here we all agree that the nicest solution\nwould be for E.A.T. to become a full-fledged national organization. We have the\npeople, ideas, and we are on the right side of the tracks. However, this implies\ncertain things. One, we must be able to operate here in New York and we must be\nable to sustain a yearly budget of between 200 and 250 thousand dollars which is\nwhat the minimum cost is to handle the daily flow of information. One of the\nimplications of the national organization is that we will have many ideas and\nexhibitions to cope with. There are many possibilities of generating national\nprojects which would actually go like waves across the country. They don\u2019t\nnecessarily have to be shows or exhibitions in the normal sense, it could be people\nconcentrating on computer or television or some material like our idea of the light\n91 Letter from Francis Mason to Jack Burnham, June 27, 1968.

In this way E.A.T. would be involved in situations\non a local level.\n\u2026My final point is that\u2026each community has its capacities and\npossibilities which are inherent to that particular area. This is due to geographical\nlocations and the way industry is distributed and the type of people who live there\nand so on. Each area is also deficient in something and let me make it clear that\nManhattan is no exception. We\u2019ve got four or five thousand artists, but we\nhaven\u2019t got the industry, and we haven\u2019t got the engineers, nor the facilities to put\nup large projects as other areas across the country do have. This means that one\ncan foresee the possibilities of collaboration where the whole idea of this type of\nactivity becomes decentralized. This is inherent in the use of technology\nanywhere.\u201d92\nDespite this rhetoric of decentralization, the initial plan more closely resembled\nthe familiar top-down hierarchy of big science. Diversity was contained by\ncentralization. A memorandum from February 1968 outlines a policy on the organization\nof local groups:\n\u201cThe majority of applications for E.A.T. membership come from outside the New\nYork City area. It has long been clear to us that Local Groups must be established\nfor E.A.T. to function most effectively all over the country. This memorandum\ncontains suggestions for establishing such Local Groups and possible activities\nthat such groups can use to take advantage of local opportunities.\u201d93\nThe group goes to great pains to establish protocols for organization, describing how\nlocal representatives should convene meetings, set up administration (\u201can administrator\nand secretary\u201d were recommended!), solicit finances, and find members:\n\u201cOrganization.\nThe local representative should call a meeting of local artists and\nengineers. E.A.T. will provide the names of the local artists and engineers who\nhave written us. Based on this local support a loose organization can be\nestablished with an administrator and a secretary. Financing for this local\nadministration should come from local sources. State Councils on the Arts can be\na source for initial administrative funds.\n92 Billy Kl\u00fcver, \u201cAddress to Local Groups Conference,\u201d audio transcript, 6/22-6/23, 1968.

Methods of making contact\nwith engineers include: direct mailings through the local chapters of engineering\nsocieties; stories in local press and industry house organs; well-publicized general\nmeetings; recruiting and giving talks at local technical and scientific conventions;\nand personal contacts.\nBringing artists and engineers together to work on projects is a very\nimportant part of the process. A formal matching procedure can be instituted.\nHowever more informal methods may be effective, for example, weekly open\nhouses where artists and engineers meet informally and do their own\n\u2018matching.\u2019\u201d94\nThe plan makes clear why E.A.T. wants to diversify: \u201cLocal situations provide unique\nopportunities for raising funds and initiating projects.\u201d95 Diversification meant site-\nspecificity. It would allow each satellite group to take advantage of specific local\nresources and industries. It would allow experimentation across new areas and\nspecializations. The group called on artists to utilize their ties to universities and schools;\nto engineering faculties; and to local industrial laboratories and technical libraries. They\nmight help members borrow equipment, get credit for loans, act as guarantors; engineer\nmembers were to persuade industrial laboratories to allow artists access.

Technology is international, and yet it is not universal. A vast field\nof possibility awaits in the translation and development of technology across\nfundamentally disparate contexts:\n\u201cThere has been spontaneous interest in our activities from all over the world and\nmany people have approached us for advice and help on starting E.A.T.\norganizations in their countries. Many activities have started on their own, and\nthe original E.A.T. idea has been carried out by individuals, independent groups,\nuniversities, museums, foundations.\n\u2026Pressures for something new come from the rate of development of\ntechnology, the consciousness of the degree of rate of change of the environment,\nthe increasing involvement of the technical community in problems in the\nenvironment, politicalization of the society in general and the artist in particular\nand general recognition of and concern about the man-machine relationship and\necological problems. The politicalization of the artist over the past year indicates\nthat the artist wants not only to change the art world but to move out of it into\ngreater social involvement. However, the technical community has become\ninvolved in problems in the environment at a faster rate than the art community.\nGiven the rate of change of non-art development, the artist is in a position of\nbecoming anachronistic and irrelevant; he is not taken seriously in those areas of\ndevelopment in the environment where he could make a valuable contribution.\nE.A.T. as an organization is based on the belief that the artist has a\nrelevant and necessary contribution to make in non-art areas in the social\nenvironment and is committed to developing as many forms in which the artist\ncan be full participant in projecting this area.\u201d148\nIn an astonishing and astonishingly prescient claim, E.A.T. argues that hardware is not\nneutral: we cannot assume that hardware can be seamlessly transferred between different\n146 See \u201cE.A.T.

He is valuable in\ndeveloping means for localizing the technology in terms of application, access\nand use, to support rather than destroy the indigenous cultural heritage and the\ndignity of the individual. There is growing recognition in the technical\ncommunity and elsewhere that the hardware need not be a fixed constant, and\nthere are no unalterable rules for using it. Whether a satellite or a tractor will\nbring a whole culture with it is an open question. But there is little known in this\narea of interface between the individual and technology and there is a great need\nfor open-ended experimentation. In such experimental situations the artists\u2019 input\nis needed.\nThese are international problems and concerns. Technology is spreading\nand the hardware is being taken up by all countries. The present structure of\nE.A.T. international contacts, which have developed from spontaneous random\ninterest, is totally inadequate and has not led to an expansion of E.A.T.\ninvolvement that corresponds to the scale of the problems and changes in the\nsocial and political environment. We plan to take the following action: E.A.T. in\nNew York will actively stimulate the setting up of independent parallel national\nE.A.T. organizations and work with them to establish an international forum for\nexchange of information hardware and people, and collaboration on projects on\ninternational scale.\nThe development of E.A.T. along these lines will begin with the\nestablishment of national organizations in Japan and India. The involvement in\nthe Pepsi Pavilion in Japan provided the contacts and impetus for the organization\nthere. Two projects in India generated initial contacts and interest. Japan is the\nmost industrialized nation in Asia and has begun to export technology; India is the\nmost acute developing nation undergoing rapid introduction for technology in a\nsituation of old, diverse and strong cultural traditions. The E.A.T. organizations\nwill be oriented to experimental projects outside a specific institutional\nframework which utilizes the skills and talents of different professionals,\nincluding the artist. In addition to doing projects inside the country, members of\nthese E.A.T. organizations would have direct contact with E.A.T. members in\nother countries to exchange information, experience, and collaborate on projects.\nAn indigenous E.A.T. organization combined with the international contact\nbetween E.A.T. organizations will provide interested people a means for effective\n284"}

The\nstructure of the art world and the social role of the artist everywhere has remained basically unchanged.\nOther forces for change have radically changed the situation. Pressures for something new come from\nthe rate of development of technology, the consciousness of the degree of rate of change of the\nenvironment, the increasing involvement of the technical community in problems in the environment,\npoliticalization of the society in general and the artist in particular and general recognition of and concern\nabout the man-machine relationship and ecological problems. The politicalization of the artist over the past\nyear indicates that the artist wants not only to change the art world but to move out of it into greater social\ninvolvement. However, the technical community has become involved in problems in the environment at a\nfaster rate than the art community. Given the rate of change of non-art development, the artist is in a\nposition of becoming anachronistic and irrelevant; he is not taken seriously in those areas of development\nin the environment where he could make a valuable contribution.\nE.A.T. as an organization is based on the belief that the artist has a relevant and necessary contribution\nto make in non-art areas in the social environment and is committed to developing as many forms in which\nthe artist can be full participant in projecting this area. The role of the artists in planning the Pepsi Pavilion\ndemonstrated their concern for the individual and their seriousness in using new technology to provide\nfreedom and variety in individual experience.\nOur experience has shown that the artist can make an important contribution in aspects of technology\nwhich involve the adaptation of technology to different cultures and environments, as it affects the\nindividual. He is valuable in developing means for localizing the technology in terms of application, access\nand use, to support rather than destroy the indigenous cultural heritage and the dignity of the individual.\nThere is growing recognition in the technical community and elsewhere that the hardware need not be a\nfixed constant, and there are no unalterable rules for using it. Whether a satellite or a tractor will bring a\nwhole culture with it is an open question. But there is little known in this area of interface between the\nindividual and technology and there is a great need for open-ended experimentation. In such experimental\nsituations the artists\u2019 input is needed.\nThese are international problems and concerns. Technology is spreading and the hardware is being\ntaken up by all countries. The present structure of E.A.T. international contacts, which have developed\nfrom spontaneous random interest, is totally inadequate and has not led to an expansion of E.A.T.\ninvolvement that corresponds to the scale of the problems and changes in the social and political\nenvironment. We plan to take the following action: E.A.T. in New York will actively stimulate the setting\nup of independent parallel national E.A.T. organizations and work with them to establish an international\nform for exchange of information hardware and people, and collaboration on projects on international\nscale.\nThe development of E.A.T. along these lines will begin with the establishment of national organizations\nin Japan and India. The involvement in the Pepsi Pavilion in Japan provided the contacts and impetus for\nthe organization there. Two projects in India generated initial contacts and interest. Japan is the most\nindustrialized nation in Asia and has begun to export technology; India is the most acute developing nation\nundergoing rapid introduction for technology in a situation of old, diverse and strong cultural traditions.\nThe E.A.T. organizations will be oriented to experimental projects outside a specific institutional\nframework which utilizes the skills and talents of different professionals, including the artist. In addition to\ndoing projects inside the country, members of these E.A.T. organizations would have direct contact with\nE.A.T. members in other countries to exchange information, experience, and collaborate on projects. An\nindigenous E.A.T. organization combined with the international contact between E.A.T. organizations will\nprovide interested people a means for effective action on the problems introduced by technology in\ndeveloped or undeveloped situations where the presence of the artist can have great importance.\u201d\n\u201cA Structure for E.A.T.

Rather, the Pavilion plunges into illusion and\nphantasmagoria, into \u201canother order of reality entirely\u201d [Fig. 4.48].229 As simulacrum, it\nmaintains resemblance only to better undermine resemblance\u2019s \u201chold over the real,\u201d as\nCamille has so beautifully put it.230\nand Simulacrum\u201d (1981), in Baudrillard, Selected Writings, ed.

See Joseph, \u201cPlastic Empathy: The\nGhost of Robert Whitman,\u201d Grey Room 25 (Fall 2006): 64-91; and Gloria Sutton, The Experience\nMachine: Stan VanDerBeek\u2019s Movie Drome and Expanded Cinema (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2015),\n156-166. For Joseph, the Pepsi Pavilion is a \u201ctemple to the narcissistic self,\u201d citing the case in which the\nimage of an individual floods the interior\u2014thus aligning with Vanderbeek and McLuhan\u2019s notions of a\nglobal village, in which the other is fully absorbed into self, without remainder; as the culmination of the\nrhetoric about expanded cinema as pure instantaneity and presence. But I would argue that this does not\naccount for the radical multiplication and distortion of the reflected image, of the \u201creal\u201d and \u201cvirtual\u201d image,\nall reflected and multiplied again in second-, third- and multiple-order images. And I would also argue\nthat, unlike VanDerBeek\u2019s Movie Drome, the Pavilion was in fact the precise opposite of environments that\nrely on the projected image; instead, the Pavilion produced \u201creal\u201d and \u201cvirtual\u201d images, reflected in real\ntime; it did not produce speed and \u201cvisual velocity\u201d but slowness; it did not induce the viewer to take a\nstatic position (often lying down) but a perambulatory one; finally, the Pepsi Pavilion is not anti-illusion,\nbut rather pushes illusion to its limits. In this sense, I would caution against false binaries of\nreal/imaginary, which the Pavilion undoes in favor of a multiplicitous subject position.\n233 Camille, \u201cSimulacrum,\u201d 45.\n234 Nakaya, quoted in Lindgren, \u201cInto the Collaboration,\u201d 41.\n316"}

{"350": "CHAPTER 5\nBEYOND CONTROL:\nAUTOMATION HOUSE\nAutomation is inseparable from accident. Such an assertion may seem surprising,\nsince the rise of technological automation after World War II is typically understood as\nthe vast implementation of control. From thermostats to computers, industrial production\nto information processing, automated systems aim at the sweeping simulation and\nregulation of cognition and action.1 But aims are not always met: Unpredictability, error,\nand malfunction are bound to the proliferation of control systems themselves. This\nturbulence is constitutive of the risk society, as defined by sociologist Ulrich Beck\u2014a\n1 \u201cControl,\u201d as we have seen, is the leitmotif that spans industrial production to artificial intelligence, from\nthe postwar fields of operations research and cybernetics to that of organizational theory. It is also, of\ncourse, the premise for Gilles Deleuze\u2019s formulation of a \u201csociety of control,\u201d which I have specifically\ndiscussed in relation to cybernetics in the previous chapters and will take up further in the last portion of\nthis chapter. On the origins of postwar control science, see S. Bennett, A History of Control Engineering\n1930-1955 (London: Peter Peregrinus, 1993); and James R. Beniger, The Control Revolution:\nTechnological and Economic Origins of the Information Society (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University\nPress, 1986). In 1965, sociologist Daniel Bell outlined the basis of automation in terms of \u201cControl,\u201d a\nsweeping technological and epistemic phenomenon: \u201cThe Age of Automation,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis part of a\nsocial transformation in which new attitudes about the world are being formed\u2026The heart of these attitudes\nlies in the idea of \u2018Control,\u2019 the growing awareness and knowledge of processes which allow us to regulate\nthe wide variety of \u2018systems\u2019 which are operative in the world: machine systems, economic systems, social\nsystems, and eventually, perhaps, political systems. Feedback mechanisms allow us to control machine\nsystems; planning devices (whether used by corporations or by government) allow us to anticipate\neconomic change and assess the consequences; organizational analysis can be used to locate strains or\ndisjunctions in complex social systems, be they hospitals, prisons, universities, voluntary associations, or\ncorporations; new intellectual tools, such as simulation or game theory, give us some means of providing a\nmore rational foundation for political decisions.\u201d Daniel Bell, \u201cPreface,\u201d Sir Leon Bagrit, The Age of\nAutomation: The BBC Reith Lecture Series 1964 (New York: Mentor Books, 1965), xi-xii.

They were to stretch the functionalities\nof the audio and video facilities at Automation House, an extensive system helmed by a\ngroup of mixing consoles in the control room, as Kl\u00fcver demonstrated at the opening.\nThe inaugural exhibition at the space was \u201cThe Magic Theater,\u201d organized by Ralph T.\nCoe and originally presented in May-June 1968 at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in\nKansas City.73 Many of the show\u2019s works made use of systematic programming only to\ndismantle or surpass it in sensory experience. Boyd Mefferd\u2019s Strobe-Lighted Floor\n(1968) [Fig. 5.16], for example, dislocated the visual apprehension of color and distance.\nThe artist lined a carpeted gallery floor in Automation House with a grid of spaced square\nlucite insets. Each overlaid a strobe light that was triggered by capacitor overflow at\nrandom intervals. Jane Livingston\u2019s description of the piece in her 1968 Artforum review\nis worth quoting at length:\n\u201cThe lights were placed beneath colored filters, but appeared white in actually\nlooking at the flash\u2014only the after-image took on color. On first entering the room,\nmy impression was that the lights emanated from walls, ceiling and floor, and even\nwhen I had become oriented in the location of the light sources, it was impossible\nto look at them, or to discover by looking at any particular spot in the room\nprecisely what was happening...at a given moment. In short, what Mefford [sic]\npresented was a way of seeing (retinal images) that does not relate to looking\ndirectly at an object or objects.\u201d74\n73 On the exhibition as originally installed at the Nelson-Atkins Museum, see: Ralph T.

In addition to its artist\u2019s residency project at RCA, E.A.T. proposed to\nthe corporation an actual independent research facility where artists could collaborate\nclosely with television research engineers and scientists, psychologists, anthropologists,\nand sociologists to explore new forms of television. In the summer of 1969, E.A.T. sent\nquestionnaires to approximately fifty artists using television in their work, inquiring as to\ntheir needs and interests in technical knowledge and facilities. In a report generated from\nthe questionnaire results, artists cited lack of freedom in experimentation, the limits of\noperating regulations, and little access to those actually designing television equipment\u2014\ndisciplinary or bureaucratic obstacles above all:\n108 For \u201cIBM Poem,\u201d Williams used a FORTRAN program to randomly generate twenty-six words\n(although the poet allows that he may have manipulated the outcome from time to time) and then associate\neach of them with a letter of the alphabet to create \u201can alphabet of words.\u201d A three-letter title was chosen,\nand the first line of the poem was determined by substituting words for letters in the title.

E.A.T. organized free screenings of the Tuesday night\nprograms at both Automation House and Max\u2019s Terre Haute restaurant, since not all\nviewers were cable subscribers (subscription costs were approximately five dollars a\nmonth).136 This panoply of emerging video artists and filmmakers was thereby able to\nhired me. I was so belligerent and so naive at the same time, but they hired me to help them put together a\npublic access cable series that was going to be broadcast from Automation House. It turned out it didn\u2019t\nwork like that at all. It never did become an [satellite] uplink. But they also invited me to work in the\nstudio down there.

{"27": "INTRODUCTION\nThe history of art and technology is a history of envy. The rival fields have long\nchallenged, borrowed, or stolen from each other. Each wants what the other has: Art\ndesires technology\u2019s seeming omnipotence, its cold power, its cutting-edge materials and\nprocesses; technology wants art\u2019s creativity, its free thinking, its radical innovation. And\nyet in spite\u2014or because\u2014of this fraught relationship, art and technology have converged\nin many ways, with enormous consequences for contemporary experience.\nThe jealousy and the joining are the subject of this dissertation. In the study that\nfollows, I examine an extraordinary moment in the twentieth century when artists and\ntechnologists came together, in both antagonism and amity: The formation of\nExperiments in Art and Technology, or E.A.T., an organization that aimed to create\nwidespread collaborations between artists and engineers. Sometimes these encounters\nreflected the postwar dream of universal connectivity, of communications media that\nwould link us all, in global simultaneity. Sometimes they reflected the dystopian\nnightmare of machines run amok, of the horrors of Vietnam and Silent Spring. But often\nthese encounters cannot simply be described as critical or affirmative, utopian or\ndespairing, conflicted or cooperative.1 Sometimes, these collaborations promised a\ndifferent horizon of possibilities, possibilities that did not merely reflect\u2014but actively\nchanged\u2014the colossal proliferation of networks to come.\n1 Thus E.A.T.\u2019s project of overt unification departs, I argue, from the sublimated union between the\nhistorical avant-gardes and instrumental technology, which Andreas Huyssen has described. The futurist\nand constructivist engagements with technology, for example, \u201creveal the secret bond between avant-garde\nand official culture in advanced industrial societies,\u201d whether that use of technology was critical or\naffirmative.

{"28": "E.A.T. was founded in 1966 by artists Robert Rauschenberg and Robert Whitman\nand Bell Laboratories engineers Billy Kl\u00fcver and Fred Waldhauer. The group sought to\nform an alliance between artists and engineers, a grand union of disciplines, fields, and\ncompetencies. But what E.A.T. produced was far more restless, complex, and divided\u2014a\nvast and unruly alchemy.\nArt and technology were divided indeed in the late 1960s, infamously split\nbetween the \u201cTwo Cultures,\u201d in the words of Cold War\u2013era doomsdayer C. P. Snow.\nMany warned that this rift would lead to technocratic domination, nuclear winter,\necological ruin. E.A.T. echoed this alarm. As the organization\u2019s inaugural manifesto\nproclaimed, culture and technology were dangerously developing \u201cin isolation.\u201d Yet their\nresponse was wholly unorthodox. Unlike Snow\u2019s technocratic call to arms, which argued\nthat culture abdicate to modern science and which Kl\u00fcver and Rauschenberg ultimately\nopposed, E.A.T. posed a way to bring disparate fields together\u2014to create a \u201ccatalyst for\nthe inevitable fusing of specializations,\u201d as Rauschenberg put it.2 If artists and engineers\nactually talked to one another, shared information, broke out of professional\nspecializations, they might change one another, change their disciplines, change the\nstructure of invention itself. The gulf between art and technology might become a\ncontest, a rivalry, and a transformation.\nRauschenberg met Kl\u00fcver in 1960. The engineer was a high-level specialist in\nlasers and optics at AT&T Bell Laboratories, epicenter of the modern\ntelecommunications revolution. Born in Monaco, raised in Sweden, then receiving his\n2.

{"29": "Ph.D. in physics at Berkeley, Kl\u00fcver had unorthodox connections from the start. The\ncurator Pontus Hult\u00e9n, a friend and fellow Swede, had introduced Kl\u00fcver to the artist\nJean Tinguely, with whom he would work on Homage to New York, a kinetic sculpture\nthat self-destructed in the Sculpture Garden of The Museum of Modern Art in 1960. It\nwas there that the engineer encountered Rauschenberg, who had constructed the small,\ncoin-tossing sculpture Money Thrower for the event; they struck up a friendship, and\nKl\u00fcver subsequently helped Rauschenberg and a number of other artists with various\nelectrical or mechanical needs. But from project to project\u2014from Jasper Johns\u2019s Field\nPainting (1962) to Andy Warhol\u2019s Silver Clouds (1965)\u2014Kl\u00fcver\u2019s participation went\nbeyond technical assistance; it altered the very form of the work.\nIn Chapters 1 and 2, I examine several of these early collaborations between\nKl\u00fcver and various artists. After his work with Johns and Tinguely, for example, Kl\u00fcver\nwould go on to produce the transistor-radio-powered, sound-emitting sculpture Oracle\n(1962\u201365) with Rauschenberg and his Bell colleague Harold Hodges. The very concept\nand material of the piece were literally shaped by its technological means. And so the\nquestion arose: what if more artists and engineers could work together and exchange\nideas, techniques, and media, generating something that neither would ordinarily produce\non their own? Or, as Rauschenberg scrawled in a note in 1967, \u201cto make work that could\nnot exist otherwise\u201d?3\nRauschenberg and Kl\u00fcver soon decided to find out. They embarked on 9\nEvenings: Theatre and Engineering\u2014a legendary performance series that would directly\nlead to the formation of E.A.T. As I argue in Chapter 2, the event was a colossal\n3 Robert Rauschenberg, handwritten note, c. 1967.

{"30": "enterprise, its ambition matched only by its size. It lasted the titular nine nights in the\ncavernous 69th Regiment Armory in New York and was attended by more than 10,000\npeople. Nearly forty engineers from Bell Laboratories worked with ten artists; their\nstruggles against and with one another brought the working methods of the industrial\nlaboratory and artistic studio into unprecedented intimacy.\nAnd yet the participants began conceiving 9 Evenings in order to bring this\nintimacy, these one-to-one collaborations, to a larger scale\u2014to see what would happen\nwhen a critical mass of artists and engineers explored new materials and technologies.\nThey connected with other artists, choreographers, and musicians\u2014many of whom\nRauschenberg had been working with since 1962 in the experimental dance and theater\ngroup \u201cBastard Theater\u201d\u2014including John Cage, Yvonne Rainer, and Deborah Hay.\nKl\u00fcver pulled in Bell colleagues who were researching everything from integrated\ncircuits to making computers talk\u2014technologies that would usher in wireless\ncommunication, personal computing, and the Internet. These were the architects of the\ninformation age.\nSuch unorthodox collaborations disturbed the model, the linear logic, of\nmodernist progress and technological innovation alike. They inspired the founding of\nE.A.T. proper. In Chapter 3, I investigate the ways in which the organization was\nstructured, funded, realized, and, most important, how it grew. I focus on the group\u2019s\nunique attempt to exponentially expand the field of experimentation\u2014by both modeling\nand diverting from the protocols of big science, the mammoth expansion in scientific and\ntechnological research in same decades; and the emergence of a global network of\ninformation and telecommunications at the very laboratory from which many of E.A.T.\u2019s\n4"}

And the network begat Bell Labs, hailed as \u201cthe world\u2019s\ngreatest industrial laboratory.\u201d4 Bell Labs envisioned a new model of scientific research\nin industry, of basic science practiced in the context of applied science. Moreover, they\npioneered the idea that a kind of critical mass could be achieved by research at a large\nscale. This was the model for modern research, multiplying in \u201caggregate force\u201d\u2014and\ngaining this force via the resources, and capital, of an industry predicated precisely on\nbuilding the largest network in the world.\nI therefore focus on E.A.T.\u2019s development of an astonishing set of media\napparatuses\u2014an early form of information processing, at the very moment of landmark\ninnovations in computing at Bell\u2014to register, sort, and match artists and engineers with\nautomation and at scale. I examine the kinds of collaborations and relationships and\nnetworks these matches generated\u2014and the phenomena of solutions without problems,\ninventions without end. Moreover, I explore the ways in which these media processes\nproduced new kinds of collaborating subjects.\nChapter 4 explores the growth but also dispersion of E.A.T., in relation to the\ndistribution of big science and large-scale research, and their strategies of diversification,\nspecialization, and expansion. I examine the tensions between these aims in big science\nwrit large, the specific case of Bell Labs, and the even more specific case of E.A.T. If\nbig science ultimately subsumed pure science into applied science, Bell Labs broke down\nthe distinctions between the two, for a brief but extraordinary period in the twentieth\ncentury.

{"32": "decentralization and centralization, E.A.T. pursued a leviathan expansion and\ndecentralization of activity, but struggled against a vertical hierarchy that would unify\nand consolidate its research. This struggle would be borne out in E.A.T.\u2019s spread via\nLocal Groups, branches of the organization around the world, and the questions of\nnetwork, system, and structure this multiplication raised. Finally, I investigate E.A.T.\u2019s\nlargest single collaboration\u2014the Pepsi Pavilion at Expo 70 in Osaka\u2014and its enactment\nof and participation in utterly new forms of simulation, computation, and experience.\nE.A.T. changed both subjects and objects, I argue, and these shifts form the focus\nof Chapter 5. Examining the crises of automation, technological development, and\naesthetic experience, I address Automation House, a building-cum-artwork that E.A.T.\nconstructed as its headquarters in New York in 1970. Here, the organization made\nmyriad efforts to create a networked, architectural space; pioneering experiments in early\ntelevision and video broadcasting; produce a participatory space of display; pursued a\nnumber of social and environmental endeavors, dubbed Projects Outside Art; and sought\nto explore the technological transformation of labor, but also the disruption of automated\nsystems, particularly those of communication. In this way, E.A.T. began to address the\ndestabilization of the institutions of capitalism and modernism, and the advent of man-\nmade catastrophes\u2014whether ecological, economic, actuarial, or military: the ways in\nwhich large-scale systems were proving not to beget order but disorder. This shift, I\nargue, provides a different way to think about power, control, technocracy, systems, and\nsubjectivity under late capitalism.\n* * *\n6"}

In a lesser-known passage from his celebrated\nessay \u201cOther Criteria,\u201d Steinberg boldly proclaimed that the progress of mid-century\nmodernist painting followed a \u201ccorporate model of artistic evolution\u201d\u2014a scenario in\nwhich \u201cthe artist as engineer and research technician becomes important insofar as he\ncomes up with solutions to the right problem.\u201d1 Steinberg argued even more heretically\nthat \u201ctasks [are] set for the artist as problems are set for researchers in the big\ncorporations,\u201d thereby equating scientific positivism and instrumentalized research with\nGreenbergian modernism\u2019s self-reflexive goal of flatness and opticality, of reducing all\npictorial elements to a \u201cpure\u201d medium of painting.2 The art historian likened Greenberg\u2019s\ndeterministic critical apparatus to the streamlined ideals of efficiency in the Detroit\n1 Leo Steinberg, \u201cOther Criteria\u201d (first presented as a lecture at the Museum of Modern Art, March 1968),\nin Steinberg, Other Criteria: Confrontations with Twentieth-Century Art (New York: Oxford University\nPress, 1972), 77-78.

Krauss thus explains Greenberg and Fried\u2019s system of\njudgment in terms of verifiability and empiricism\u2014leading her to point out the practices (such as sculpture)\nthat remain unaccounted for by this theoretical apparatus.

In fact, color takes on the status of an active force or process. If Johns generally\naddressed color as an entire spectral set of red, yellow, and blue pigment (or, later, their\ncomplementary colors of orange, green and purple), in Zone the luminescent neon blue\nfinds its uncanny partners in the mottled, prefab yellow of the paintbrush handle and the\nbrownish-red \u201cresidue\u201d in the dangling coffee cup\u2014all various forms of readymade color\nthat serve as indices for actions and processes in addition to that of painting, whether\nelectrical, industrial, or gustatory.22\nSuch experimental procedures and materials challenged both visual certitude and\nscientific empiricism.

Once\nlit, neon lamps exhibit the characteristic of \u201cnegative resistance\u201d\u2014increasing the current\nflow through the device decreases the resistance of the lamp and allows even more\ncurrent to flow. To counteract this tendency, electrical circuitry external to the lamp must\nprovide a means to limit current flow through the circuit or else the current will rapidly\nincrease until the lamp is destroyed. If the current runs too low, however, the lamp will\nflicker and eventually die out. For lamps the size of the letters in Zone and Field\nPainting (approximately 8 inches long), a specially constructed voltage transformer is\nstretcher was used as a connecting wire to a 3,000 volt neon bulb.

In these works, then, the two axes of vertical \u201cwindow\u201d and horizontal\nflatbed are joined by a third: a coursing field of the electromagnetic and the gaseous.\nZone and Field Painting represent the irruption of the flatbed picture plane into a literally\ndynamic system of particles and waves.\nAnd this was not the only incursion. The engineers\u2019 introduction of neon systems\ninto Zone and Field Painting also radically extended Johns\u2019s manipulation of the\nDuchampian readymade. For Steinberg, the flatbed picture plane found perhaps its \u201cmost\nvital source\u201d in Duchamp.

Oracle\u2019s window of\nconstruction predates Silver Clouds by one year, but I would like to go back to this\nslightly earlier piece in order to chart major shifts occurring in Rauschenberg\u2019s own work\nin the mid-1960s, changes parallel to the experimentation with Silver Clouds and equally\ndivergent from the moment of Rauschenberg\u2019s White Paintings in 1951-53. For, after the\nartist met Kl\u00fcver in 1960 during the engineer\u2019s collaboration with Jean Tinguely,\nRauschenberg\u2019s continuing relationship with Kl\u00fcver was to redefine his practice through\nthe deployment of collaboration. In Oracle, the contact between engineers and artists\nmade possible an investigation of densely hybrid configurations of media and subjective\nexperience, a foray into what could be called the \u201ccybernetic\u201d conditions of forecasting\nand prediction.1\n1 This onset of Rauschenberg\u2019s so-called \u201ctechnological\u201d work should not be seen as a negative caesura, the\ndemise of the artist\u2019s aspirations toward difference and hybridity into works that promoted a na\u00efve, switch-\nlike determinacy of participation\u2014thereby inscribing the very spectacularity and instrumentality in the\naesthetic experience that the White Paintings and Combines had worked so hard to escape. Ironically,\nRauschenberg\u2019s \u201ctechnological\u201d work is simultaneously accused of not being spectacular enough, of being\ntoo technically simplistic and thus disappointing. But the paradoxical double bind of such an account\nmisses the hybrid nature and complex set of responses elicited by the work, its production, and its\nengagement with media and control systems.

This is a type of device that uses a\nfeedback loop, acting continuously on the basis of incoming information to attain a\nspecified goal in the face of changes.24 The system of motors that Hodges devised was\none such control mechanism: it constantly adjusted to dynamically changing input from\nthe audience\u2019s manipulation of the dials on Oracle\u2019s control unit. If the speed of the\nmotors increased or decreased beyond a certain point, the system would self-correct\ntoward an average speed\u2014and thereby modulate the rate at which the radios were\nchanging frequencies.\nOracle\u2019s motor system thus approximated a simple model of contemporary\ncybernetics, the theory of control mechanisms developed over several decades beginning\nin the 1920s and named by mathematician Norbert Wiener in the mid-1940s.

Black\u2019s work, for example, was part of a nexus of\nresearch at Bell that was subsequently furthered by Harry Nyquist, whose classical work\non the stability of feedback amplifiers yielded axioms pertaining to feedback control\ntheory, bandwidth requirements, and thermal noise, each instrumental for Shannon\u2019s\ninformation theory and the understanding of feedback and dynamic systems.27 While the\nbroader implications of control engineering research for the development of Experiments\nin Art and Technology will be discussed in the next chapters, I want to note here the ways\nin which Oracle can be understood as both firmly embedded within and yet keenly\ntroubling this discourse of cybernetics and servomechanisms\u2014of violence, information,\nand control.\nFor if cybernetics\u2014and the broad array of devices whose properties it defined\u2014\nwas predicated on the regulation and adjustment of dynamic systems, Oracle was a\nsystem that activated its own interruption or diversion.

Such a\nconception was already presaged in Cage\u2019s first piece to incorporate radio, Imaginary\nLandscape No. 4 (1951).

{"92": "Oracle extends the active role of the \u201cperformer\u201d to any and all passerby.52 It impedes\nthe direct relationship between the body, mechanical controls, and tuning/volume output;\nand, most important, it embeds the radio system in resolutely heavy, lumbering,\nsculptural form. Building on Cage\u2019s work and yet surpassing certain of its assumptions,\nOracle confronted the ways in which radio\u2019s plenary diversity was also a sophisticated\nrealization of the customization of capital and the privatization of networks, spaces, and\nthings. This was not an unimpeded ether, \u201cfree for an infinite play of interpenetration,\u201d\nbut an uneven and irregular realm of discrete pockets and aporias.\nOracle realized seminal aspects of what McLuhan termed radio\u2019s \u201cacoustic\nspace\u201d\u2014a realm that did not posit geometrical spatial relations, that possessed neither\ncenter or periphery, since hearing occurs from all directions simultaneously.53 With\nLandscape #4\u201d (1951), in which twelve radios were \u2018played\u2019 by twenty-four performers.\u201d Joseph, Random\nOrder, 185.\n52 In this sense, Oracle also departs from another earlier, related work, George Brecht\u2019s event score Candle\nPiece for Radios (1959), which was likely written as \u201chomework\u201d for John Cage\u2019s class in experimental\ncomposition at the New School and derived from the latter\u2019s Imaginary Landscape No. 4. Brecht\u2019s piece\ndirects performers to manipulate the volume and tuning dials of a set number of radios according to specific\ndirections distributed on instruction cards. When a performer drew a card, he would follow those\ninstructions as to the precise direction and amount to turn the volume and tuning dials on a radio; the\nnumerical values of each adjustment were determined by a table of random numbers. Even Brecht,\nhowever, admitted that this system of instructions seemed overdetermined, and that it involved too many\ninstruction cards; this type of extensive performative instruction and controlled environment seems at odds\nwith the parameters of Oracle.

Bott, his peer at the University of Toronto. Against the linear, fragmented order of vision and the\nprinted word, McLuhan proposed that acoustic space defined the nodal, relational, and decentered network\nof electronic communications. See Marshall McLuhan, The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of\nTypographic Man (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1962). The notion of an aural (and non-visual)\nordering of space also developed in the discourse on film sound, most notably by Christian Metz in his\nseminal essay \u201cAural Objects\u201d.

McLuhan cites Bertolt Brecht\u2019s \u201cRadio Poem,\u201d n.d., in this regard;\nBrecht was, of course, one of the most acute observers of the empathic intensity of radio and its potentially\nrevolutionary effects: \u201cThere is a little poem by the German dramatist Berthold Brecht: \u2018You little box,\nheld to me when escaping / So that your valves should not break, / Carried from house to ship from ship to\ntrain, / So that my enemies might go on talking to me / Near my bed, to my pain / The last thing at night,\nthe first thing in the morning, / Of their victories and of my cares, / Promise me not to go silent all of a\nsudden.\u2019\u201d Ibid.\n55 Ibid., 299.

There were about 2,500 people out there chafing at the bit and\nnothing worked. It was pretty crucial and I remember there was a lot of suppressed tearing of hair and\nHartig (the man in charge of the infrared TV for Rauschenberg) went around and pulled all the plugs out of\nthe current supplies, took some snippers and cut the ground pole off each plug servicing the projectors,\nturned the plug around and plugged it back in. That\u2019s all it took and everything was on. It was as dumb as\nthat. Very complex equipment but it was just like turning around the plug on a toaster\u2026. I also remember\nsomeone telling Rauschenberg that he had to go upstairs and start mixing his imagery. He said, \u2018Oh, my\nGod!\u2019 He hadn\u2019t thought of that, hadn\u2019t done it before, and hadn\u2019t had time to rehearse or anything else.\nHis famous quote is, \u2018I\u2019ll think of something,\u2019 which seemed pretty cool for a guy who was putting together\nsuch an elaborate piece. I remember another thing about Rauschenberg\u2019s piece. It seems to me we were\nvery moved up on the balcony. I remember some tears going around. It was a very moving piece for some\nreason\u2014unembarrassedly so. There was Les Levine, John Giorno, myself and Rauschenberg up on the\nbalcony. And Hartig was there. In the first performance everybody repeated their names in the dark and\nthey blew the tape. \u2026Who knew that everytime they hit the tennis ball it would turn lights out. Obviously,\nthe comment there was you could do the whole thing with switches. The technology thing is always up for\ngrabs in things like that. How complicated it is is in the background, people lose their sense of proportion\nthat way. The dramatic effect was the same, automatic or not. Those are those little victories and deceits.\nUnheralded I guess. I just remember being moved by that first time around. All those people announcing\ntheir names was a little bit like \u2018Our Town.\u2019 We were all so grateful that the thing finally did work\u2026. We\ncouldn\u2019t see what the audience was seeing.

This was, needless to say, a daunting task. Indeed, the lesson of 9\nEvenings seemed to be that artists and engineers were eager to collaborate, but that\ncollaborations themselves\u2014and the access, communication, materials, tools, and settings\nneeded to make them possible\u2014were enormously difficult to realize.

This has enabled Latour to pursue a vigorous,\natomistic dissection of research and laboratory practice. In fact, his model has\nincreasingly been marshaled as a reference in the distant field of contemporary art, in\norder to map present-day relations of artistic exchange and reception.

{"144": "Much has been made of the amounts of capital at stake here, which seemed\nstaggering relative to the asceticism of performance art and theater at the time (see\nChapter 2). It seemed to go against the very grain of Rauschenberg\u2019s, let alone Cage\u2019s,\npractice\u2014not to mention the willfully stripped-down aesthetic of Judson, Fluxus, or\nHappenings. But, in fact, the funding program for E.A.T. directly reflected\nRauschenberg\u2019s own extraordinary experimentation with models of funding. If\nRauschenberg himself initially put up funds for the organization, this was in keeping with\nhis exploration of unorthodox patronage structures and posing of alternatives to the\ncommercial gallery, often financially supporting projects himself.\nAnd if the expenditures were great, the risk incurred was greater: a deficit of\n$50,000 remained after the performances, surely making this a bad, or at least\nspeculative, investment if ever there was one. Gorewitz and attorney Franklin\nKonigsberg attempted to fundraise to cover these remaining costs. Rauschenberg put up\n$100,000 worth of paintings as collateral. Again, the FCPA was ultimately responsible\nfor the majority of debt relief.\nAfter 9 Evenings, Kl\u00fcver and Rauschenberg launched a benefit exhibition at\nCastelli from December 6-10, 1966 (organized by Alex Hay and Lucinda Childs, and\nwith artists from Arakawa to Sturtevant, Oldenburg to Brion Gysin, donating artworks for\nsale) to begin fundraising for E.A.T. itself. Kl\u00fcver and Rauschenberg then set about\napplying for outside grants from the government, large nonprofit organizations such as\nSeptember 22, 1966, from meeting of representatives of Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts,\nInc. and Experiments in Art and Technology, Inc. at the offices of Paul, Weiss, Rijkind, Wharton, &\nGarrison, 4.

{"145": "the Ford Foundation, and professional societies such as the IEEE, the Institute for\nElectrical and Electronics Engineers.29\nThis fundraising push coincided with nothing less than the invention of the public\nart trust in the postwar period. The National Endowment for the Arts had just been\nfounded in 1964 and the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1965, for example.\nAs a result, artists would spend almost as much time writing grant proposals as making\nart. But the founders of E.A.T. never intended for the organization to operate under the\naegis of a governmental or academic institution. This sharply contrasted with virtually\nevery other art and technology venture at the time. E.A.T.\u2019s structure was markedly\ndistinct from Zero, for example, whose practice would find its ultimate home in the\nuniversity, at Kepes\u2019s and Piene\u2019s CAVS program at MIT. Nor did E.A.T. want museum\nexhibitions to be their primary mode of reception. This ran counter to finite museum\nendeavors such as LACMA\u2019s \u201cArt and Technology\u201d show, in which institutional\ndisplay\u2014the single exhibition\u2014was the end result of collaborative activity.\nIn short, neither E.A.T.\u2019s financial nor its structural status fit into known models\nfor arts patronage, administration, or museological display. And this is why E.A.T.\ncannot entirely be defined in terms of the critique\u2014or affirmation\u2014of institutions. For\nsuch critique historically depended on the definition of institutions, from the museum to\nthe very concept of modernism, as synonymous with the static, disciplinary strictures of\nscientific positivism. As Benjamin H. D. Buchloh has argued in his watershed reading of\nConceptual art, modernist empiricism originated in nineteenth-century scientific\npositivism\u2014and therefore in technological rationality, the \u201cfounding logic of capitalism\u201d;\n29 E.A.T.

{"146": "its logical outcome would be tautology.30 It would be the mandate of artists such as Sol\nLeWitt to both reflexively reproduce and ultimately contest such tautologies. Yet even as\nit included many of these artists as members, E.A.T. departs from the Conceptual project.\nOn the one hand, E.A.T. could be seen to have pushed the \u201caesthetics of administration\u201d\nto its very limit\u2014to a degree of imbrication and extension in structures of technological\nrationality wholly unmatched in postwar art. On the other hand, E.A.T. faced a different\ntechno-scientific regime: a condition that could no longer be characterized by older\nmodels of administration, positivism, rationality, and bureaucracy, nor by an older logic\nof capitalism. Instead, E.A.T. broached new, shifting realms of reason, scientific method,\ntechnological invention, and aesthetic, organizational, and economic systems. It reflected\nand confronted another world.\nIn this, E.A.T. shares some of the affirmative character of Pop and Minimalism,\nnot to mention that of Cage. Yet affirmation and mimesis were not the only implications\nof these movements. Nor was critical negation the only implication of Conceptualism.\nOther scenarios were posed, most significantly for their modeling of nascent fields of\ncontrol\u2014fields that differed from modernist institutions of sovereign power and positivist\nreason because of their flexibility, their atomization, their multiplicity.31 So while E.A.T.\n30 Buchloh, \u201cConceptual Art 1962-1969: From the Critique of Institutions to the Aesthetics of\nAdministration,\u201d 115. On tautology and recursive temporality, see Lee, Chronophobia, 80-81.\n31 I would therefore argue that the stakes for the precise historical moment of E.A.T. are no longer fully\ncongruent with those of Herbert Marcuse, whose famous diagnosis of technological rationality penetrating\nthe subject\u2014not only the body but further inward, to the unconscious, and outward, to all social relations,\nso that \u201cdomination is transfigured into administration\u201d\u2014in the 1960s represents a transition between\nearlier Frankfurt School analyses of institutional power and subsequent formulations of a \u201ccontrol society,\u201d\nbut that still relies on many of the assumptions and methodologies of the former. (Ultimately, both models\nare problematic because they are too totalizing, as I will elaborate in the next chapters, but in different ways\nand with different definitions of power and control.)

E.A.T. must be viewed apart from the dialectics of institutional critique. It\nmust be framed in a history of media and technology that does not simply consign media\nto the role of bogeyman, avatar of alienation or subjugation or war.32 It must be\nunderstood in terms of messy networks rather than monolithic institutions; new\nepistemologies and not positivism; risk and not totalizing control; multiplicitous\nprocesses, techniques, and technologies rather than signs or words alone. It must be\nconsidered at a moment when technology itself\u2014the laboratory, the experiment, the\ninnovation\u2014was in the throes of massive transformation and expansion.\nHistorian of science Matthew Wisnioski has shown that engineers in the 1960s\ndid pursue forms of radical critique, joining with leftist political organizations, and at\nleast one group, Science for the People, founded in 1969, explicitly brought leftist politics\nand hard science together. E.A.T. is undoubtedly close to this milieu.

Even as it attempts to cater to an audience that might not\nbe familiar with contemporary art, making its case to appeal to the practical aims of\nengineers, the lecture is bracing, highly contradictory, ranging from quantum mechanics\nto Susan Sontag\u2019s \u201cOn Style.\u201d\nAppropriately enough, Kl\u00fcver begins with interaction: with the exciting\ndevelopments in contemporary art and its \u201ctransgression into different forms,\u201d briefly\nciting Happenings and 9 Evenings as two examples of such intermedial contravention.\nAnd transgression across different boundaries is intimately linked to the topic of the\nfuture. An \u201cartist friend\u201d told him, he says, that people have two things on their mind\nwhen they think about the future: technology and drugs. With this quintessentially\ncountercultural combination, then, Kl\u00fcver begins a meditation on experience and\nsociological interaction. If Cage had said that \u201ctechnology breeds agreement,\u201d drugs\nmake it \u201cunnecessary to have agreements.\u201d One is active, outward; the other is passive,\ninwardly directed. One is interactive, the other solipsistic. In this, Kl\u00fcver seems to\nchoose the path of technology as a mind-altering substance, a conduit for experience that\nis fundamentally social: \u201cFew artists I know take drugs [nb: I find this hard to believe!];\nbut all are interested in technology. The contemporary artist\u2019s involvement or desire to\nbe involved with technology signifies his wish to be involved with society.\u201d The future,\nfor Kl\u00fcver, would be predicated on interaction\u2014interaction between ever-evolving and\ncurrently distant domains.\n132"}
{"159": "Referring to the legacy of \u201cAristotle, Leonardo, Van Eyck, the Futurists, the\nConstructivists, Schwitters, and the Bauhaus movement\u201d as precursors of an interaction\nbetween art and technology, Kl\u00fcver argues that these historical precedents relegated\ntechnology to a passive role. It is only with the modern intervention of Duchamp, Cage,\nand Johns, he says, that technology might be allowed agency\u2014that the arbitrary,\nsubjective, bourgeois, \u201ctraditional values\u201d of art be consigned to the dustbin. \u201cDuchamps\n[sic] suggested that the vector space that forms the world of the artist must never be\nexperienced as a complete set. The artist must be conscious of the process of being an\nartist and hence of his own unawareness, of his not-knowing. \u2026 The meaning of art is\nnot to communicate what we already know but what we don\u2019t know, to dislocate our\nvision, to make us look \u2026 Art is not a comment on or a criticism of the world.\u201d He then\nquotes Sontag: \u201c\u2019A work of art cannot advocate anything at all\u2019\u201d; and the legendary\nphysicist Paul Dirac, who \u201cinsists on the measurable, observable reality rather than the\nvalidity of abstract mathematical concepts. Dirac has been to physics what Duchamps\n[sic] has been to art.\u201d\nAbove all, this is a form of realism: a desire to \u201cenjoy the complexity of the\nworld rather than be terrified by it.\u201d And this openness to complexity and contingency,\nobviously informed by Cage, is also a kind of materialism or immanence. Art is not there\nto \u201cmake order out of chaos\u201d; rather, as Kl\u00fcver quotes Sontag: \u201c\u2019Art is not only about\nsomething, it is something. A work of art is a thing in the world, not just a text or\ncommentary on the world.\u2019\u201d Apart from metaphysics, knowledge, moral judgment, or\n\u201ctraditional values,\u201d art is \u201csomething like an excitation.\u201d\n133"}

Moreover, \u201cThe contemporary artist\nwants the engineer. The contemporary artist sees the engineer as his collaborator, his\nmaterial and his inspiration.\u201d Articulating an idea that he will repeat throughout the\nhistory of E.A.T., Kl\u00fcver refers to the engineer himself as a material: the coming\ntogether of these vastly different spheres of experience, knowledge, perception, and\nrepresentation means nothing less than an upending of subject-object distinctions.\nWhat does this mean for actual interactions between artists and engineers?\nKl\u00fcver is adamant that industry be financially and logistically responsible; that new\ntechnology be prioritized (so that the artist \u201cmay catch up\u201d).

I knew what I wanted and it was\nsimply a matter of finding someone to build it. This approach changed in\nproportion to what I found out about how things got made. It became less and\nless a matter of being in a studio thinking of things, making the plans and sending\nthem off to the fabricator. More and more it became a matter of incorporating\nmethods and materials I had found out about in the process of being related to\nparticular fabricators. The process of working became more direct and also more\ncomplex\u2014involving as it would not only the ever increasing acquisition of\ntechnical information but also the development of a social and executive sense\nwhich had not been necessary when I made the work myself in the studio.\u201d78\nIn other words, instead of less interaction with material or informational process\u2014the\nartist as conceptual ideator, merely placing an order for fabrication\u2014the artist himself\nbegins to absorb the knowledge, the technical information, the skill, as well as the\nexecutive, social, and organizational habitus, bringing all of these complex processes\nback into his or her own orbit. Working becomes more \u201cextended,\u201d and more open-\nended:\n\u201cWorking became a very extended situation of making appointments, visiting\nfactories and gathering information. The more I found out and the more people I\nmet who were interested in helping, the less it seemed necessary to plan\neverything either precisely or completely in advance. More work got made easier\nby leaving certain problems open for others to work out. I began accepting\nsolutions suggested by others which showed up in the finished work in very\nspecific ways\u2014and in ways which I had not preconceived. More possibilities\noccurred.

Morris continues: \u201cWhat is interesting to me about E.A.T. is that it seems\nto be a pretty maximum resource for a much more extended kind of corporate making\u2026\u201d\nUnlike his own previous practice and even that of Nine Evenings, where the individual\nartist still seems to possess a kind of traditional control,\n\u201cI think this type of product control is being questioned by younger people\u2026I\nthink the broader awareness and more extended involvement in social, political as\nwell as artistic action indicates a less professionalistic, less specialist, less\nproduct-oriented tendency. Possibly these people will be able to utilize the\nfacilities E.A.T. offers for a more extended way of working which involves the\ncooperation and initiative of many. But if this is true, I do not know what is\npossible in these new terms. It would be boring to try to predict its nature. It\nwould seem that getting many unlikely things tried would be more relevant than\ndemanding particular successes.\nI hope E.A.T. can maintain and develop roots in many extended processes\nand connect to many diverse people. By being open, available and diverse, it will\nbe a means that has not existed before.

This testimony goes slightly against the grain of Morris\u2019s other writings at the\ntime\u2014specifically, his articulation of \u201ccontrol\u201d in his \u201cNotes on Sculpture\u201d essays of 1966: \u201cControl is\nnecessary if the variables\u2026are to function,\u201d Morris argued, in contrast to his fascination with a certain lack\nof control in the E.A.T. text.

The discrepancy evinces a certain anxiety with regard to E.A.T. in relation to his own work and\nrelations of power, an anxiety that lends a different inflection to the fraught overlap (or, in Foster\u2019s words,\n\u201ccrux\u201d) between Minimalism and Conceptual art.

All became linkages that were themselves linked in the network of networks of the\norganizational complex. \u2026 Again, we are confronted here with a situation of control through feedback.\nOrganization, as a means of control, is necessarily a function of the various nodes through which its forces\nflow. And architecture, as one constitutive node among many in the network, acts as both receiver and\ntransmitter of patterned organizational codes, thereby gaining its status as one among many technologies of\norganization.\u201d Martin, The Organizational Complex, 214-215. In another register, Cage had articulated the\nconvergence of order and disorder in a kind of transparent equilibrium\u2014precisely through the organic:\n\u201cWhere there\u2019s a history of organization (art), introduce disorder. Where there\u2019s a history of\ndisorganization (world society), introduce order. \u2026 We need for instance an utterly wireless technology.\nJust as Fuller domes (dome within dome, translucent, plants between) will give impression of living in no\nhome at all (outdoors), so all technology must move toward way things were before man began changing\nthem: identification with nature in her manner of operation, complete mystery.\u201d John Cage, \u201cDiary: How\nto Improve the World (You Will Only Make Matters Worse) 1965,\u201d A Year From Monday: New Lectures\nand Writings (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1967), 3-21; see also Aspen 4 (Spring 1967).\nIndeed, much of the \u201cDiary\u201d essay stemmed from Cage\u2019s interchanges with Kl\u00fcver about communication\nsystems, wireless networks, technology, and organization.

On the body of the card you can write, type, draw, Xerox, stamp, staple of glue small\nphotographs, negatives or clippings.\u201d The instructions go on to enumerate salient features: Each card has a\ndogeared corner, so that when they are stacked, you can see at a glance the orientation of the card; a \u201cdeck\u201d\nis a collection of cards that you keep together; a \u201csubdeck\u201d is part of a deck.

{"204": "EATEX, the group declared, was directly linked to the group\u2019s increasing size\u2014and\ntherefore the amount of information that needed to be processed in order to produce\ncollaborations:\n\u201cEATEX is the outgrowth of the large and increasing demand that has arisen for\ntechnical information and assistance on the part of artists and other professionals\nin the area of art and technology. It is offered as a service of E.A.T. to provide\nthe artistic and technical communities with a directory of artists, scientists,\nengineers, researchers and other professionals; and their areas of expertise and\ninterests in participation. EATEX is a directory, a repository of artistic and\ntechnical expertise to be shared and exchanged. By using EATEX, one person\nmay contact another person directly for information, assistance or collaboration in\nthe shortest time and in the most direct manner possible.\u201d150\nThe scale, rapidity, and flexibility of the system paralleled the promise of the Memex. To\nparse the information itself, \u201csymbolic coding forms\u201d compatible with the IBM 7090\ncomputer (in use by Bell since the early 1960s) were to be filled out by members with\nname, interests, etc. [Fig. 3.31].151 The forms, interestingly enough, were part of what\nIBM dubbed the \u201cSHARE 7090 System,\u201d so named for the user community that\ndeveloped around the 7090. The \u201cshared\u201d information from each form would then be\ncoded as instructions on a punch card and entered into the system.

The convergence\nof home computer, television, and telephone lines as the nexus of a new social machinery testifies to an\nundoing of the spectacular consumption of the commodity. And, paradoxically, television, which had\nelevated the commodity to the height of spectacular space, is now implicated in the collapse of that space\nand the consequent evaporation of aura around the body of the commodity \u2026 we have witnessed the\ngradual displacement of aura from images of possessible objects to digitized flows of data.\u201d (The TV soap\nopera General Hospital is Crary\u2019s prime example.)

And, not coincidentally, Crary\u2019s key example is the semiconductor\u2014essentially an invention of\nBell Labs and a product of its creation of the modern transistor: \u201cthe semiconductor, that quintessential\nobject of 1980s capitalism. A product of \u2018postindustrial\u2019 industry, the semiconductor ship is a conductive\nsolid with infinitely alterable logical properties that amplifies and codifies flows of power. Unique\nspecifications are produced\u2026by actually rearranging the atoms of the substances. And recently it has\nbecome clear how some semiconductor materials (e.g., gallium arsenide) are optically as well as\nelectronically active: circuits of light and circuits of electricity are interchangeable, subject to the same\ndigitization, dollar quantification, and maximizations of speed. According to the same axioms, television\nand the semiconductor operate by decomposing and remaking a field to achieve optimum patterns of\ncirculation. Both intensify distribution flows while at the same time imposing intricate circuitries of\ncontrol.\u201d Ibid., 293. Crary predicts a new highly articulated, coercive apparatus, of corporal regimentation\n[in the video display terminal, or VDT]; and yet this does not fully account for the mode of full interactivity\nand communicability that would come to pass today, or that E.A.T. modeled.\n184"}

If engineers and technicians need new\ngrist for their mills (and I seriously believe they do) then why do artists continue\nto be obsessed with symbols or metaphors that are well known and explored?\nTheir chief value to the human race has always been in their function to be the\nprecursors of consciousness.

{"229": "technological resources and sophistication needed to engineer a project such as\nPanamarenko\u2019s was hopelessly out of reach. For Panamarenko, who had turned from\nproto-Conceptual assemblages in the 1960s to the dirigibles that would consume the rest\nof his career, the design problem of the personal flying vehicle was in and of itself an\nongoing investigation that need not be fulfilled, or work. After correspondence with\nPoole and these engineers, Panamarenko would go on to attempt to implement some\naspects of Pruner\u2019s recommendations, producing highly complex blueprints and designs;\nbut he would never successfully produce a personal, wingless flying device of this\nscale.221 His interaction with E.A.T. attested to the endlessness of his project\u2014an\nopenness and infinitude that could not have been more different from the scientistic\npositivism of Buckminster Fuller\u2019s breathlessly optimistic schemes.222 If Fuller made\nengineering utopian, Panamarenko made it weird.\nEngineering took another turn in Hans Haacke\u2019s Photo-Electric Viewer-\nControlled Coordinate System, 1968 [Figs. 3.47, 3.48]. First shown at Howard Wise\nGalllery, the work comprised a full floor-to-ceiling grid of infrared beams; viewers\u2019\nmovements would trigger photo-sensors that would control incandescent light bulbs\narrayed in a row at mid-level. In the beginning, in 1967, Haacke had written to E.A.T.\nwith a membership form and proposal for a \u201cPhoto-electrically sensitized \u2018environment\u201d\nfor a solo show in January 1968 at Howard Wise Gallery [Fig. 3.49]:\n\u201cA dark, square room, 13 feet long and 13 feet wide, with an entrance, that\nequally serves as exit, of approximately 2 feet, in one corner.

On two adjoining walls, equally at intervals\nof 1 ft., but slightly lower, i.e. at approximately chest level, infra-red photo-relays\nwill be situated. On the opposite two adjoining walls will be the complimentary\nprojectors. Twenty-four infra-red projectors and 24 relays are needed. It is\nimportant that these projectors emit only invisible light, and it is also desirable\nthat the relays be silent in their operation. The incandescent bulbs are connected\nwith the relays in such a way that, whenever the projector-relay infra-red light\nbeam is interrupted, the bulbs directly above these respective pieces of equipment\nlight up immediately. Assuming that a person in this room under normal\ncircumstances breaks two beams (perpendicular to each other), four bulbs will\nlight up at once, one on each of the four walls. If there is more than one person in\nthe room, more lights will be on, four lights for each person. Thus the number of\npersons in the room determines the degree of illumination. The gallery has A.C.\ncurrent, with numerous outlets, each with a separate 15 amp.

The viewer was never quite sure of the chain of reactions\nor events\u2014as if the work was enacting the nonlinearity and contingency of technology\nitself.226 The responsive system highlights the distinction between system and\nenvironment, self-reference and external reference, a system of interdependent processes\nrather than a discrete object. This immanent understanding of the system diverged from\nBurnham\u2019s early analysis of Haacke\u2019s work, which ultimately veered into a utopian\nnotion of interactivity and autonomy.

{"238": "Ralph and I both talked with the candidates and explained the ground\nrules: that the idea had originated with Singer and that they would make their\nchoice from a number of people. All the artists were interested and turned up on\nTuesday to talk with Richard Decker, the engineer in charge of the project, and Ed\nWebb, a physicist and engineer who will be the collaborator working with the\nartist.\nDecker and Webb were much impressed by all of the artists, as were the\nartists by them. The Singer people had in fact been so impressed that they\nforesaw great difficulty in making up their minds. They have since done so and\nnotified me that Bochner was their man.\u201d247\nThe facilities at Singer were cutting-edge, with nascent computer scanning and graphics\ncapabilities:\n\u201cThe equipment is available at the laboratory to scan a two-dimensional artistic\nrendition in color and convert to computer language. The exploratory research to\nbe conducted by Mr. Bochner and Mr. Webb will be aimed at introducing the\nartist to the purpose of expressing himself directly through the computer and the\nvarious output devices to which it may connect.\u201d248\nAnd so, starting in September 1968, Bochner went to Singer\u2019s laboratory in\nDenville, New Jersey, once a week for about four months. There, he gained access to\nprecisely the sophisticated scientific and photographic equipment in which he had\nprofessed interest. As Bochner recounted, \u201cI didn't want to be there as a \u2018tourist.\u2019 I\nwanted to be there on exactly the same terms as the scientists, so I demanded a salary\u2014\nwhatever the average salary was for a research scientist. I knew it was the only way to be\ntaken seriously. My second requirement was an office, so I was physically part of that\nsituation.\u201d249\n247 Ibid.

{"239": "Most of Bochner\u2019s time was spent in conversations with staff, which he recorded\nin a notebook every day; these conversations centered on how to communicate\nexperience and information, and thus quantification. Bochner would create a Xerox book\nof these thoughts, titled The Singer Notes (1968).250 In it, the artist details ideas for\nfeeding numbers into a computer that would generate permutations of those numbers and\nprint them out as photographs. And yet, as Bochner later recounted, the programmers\ncould not write a program that would perform these operations fast enough\u2014it would be\nmuch more convenient to simply do them by hand. Ironically, as the Singer press release\nhad stated, the facilities existed to perform the inverse operation: to convert a color\nphotograph into \u201ccomputer language,\u201d FORTRAN. It was in this sense that Bochner\ncould entertain the question of conversion from image to information: from photography\nto digital code, from index to symbol, and vice versa, thus figuring the loss of\nindexicality from photographic ontology. As Bochner states,\n\u201cI was very fortunate through EAT to get the opportunity to work at the Singer\nlabs, which were out in New Jersey, and I think Singer, which had diversified\nfrom sewing machines, felt some competition with AT&T because they were both\ninto all kinds of aero space things, at that point. They thought it might be\ninteresting to have an artist come out and do work in a think tank situation with\nthe scientists and engineers there. And basically it was about three months, two\ndays a week, of just sitting around and talking with these guys and trying to find\nsomething to talk about. What we might have in common, what we might\ndisagree with, what points on which our interests might overlap. this is what they\ndid for a living, what they did every day. It was research and development,\nbrainstorming new things for the company to produce, sitting around the table,\nscribbling notes to themselves.

{"240": "\u201cOne idea,\u201d Bochner notes, \u201cwas to find a way to use their high-powered computers to\ntranslate some of my number drawings directly into photographic images. But in those\ndays you couldn't type directly into a computer; everything had to be translated into a\nprogramming language called FORTRAN. The programmer said it would take him six\nmonths to write the program, making it faster for me to do it by hand. So much for\ncomputer-generated images in 1968!\u201d252\nBochner still, however, pursued technological media that he could not have tested\notherwise. As the Singer Notes detail, Bochner was interested in the conversion of color\nto \u201cdigital output,\u201d whether using scanning, another newly evolving technology, or a\nvector graphic system (vector graphics, in which shapes are defined by mathematical\ncurves, are one basis for digital graphics today) [Fig. 3.52].253 Bochner headlined the\nsheet with the mandate: \u201cQUALITY TO QUANTITY TRANSDUCTION.\u201d And so\nqualitative to quantitative became, for Bochner, a way of investigating the conversion of\nmaterial to information, or visual perception to numbers. While the computers could not\nactually handle the quantity of data at stake, Bochner played with video and photography.\nBochner seemed to outline one such experiment in his notes as another transduction:\n\u201cTELEVISION IMAGE TO PHOTO IMAGE / TRANSDUCTION.\u201d The artist set up a\nvideo feed of four wooden blocks arrayed on a grid, then toggled the vertical hold setting\nof the video camera, creating a stuttering and blurring image on the monitor. He\nphotographed the monitor, creating eight gelatin silver prints titled Roll (1968), which, at\n20 x 24 inches each, the curved frame of the monitor set into each picture, served as\n252 Mel Bochner, \u201cMedia Study,\u201d Artforum International 51, no. 1 (September 2012): 463.\n253 Bochner, Singer Notes, n.p.\n214"}

Four years before Joan Jonas\u2019s\nseminal Vertical Roll would underscore the groundlessness of video, its irreducibility to a\nspecific medium, Bochner\u2019s Roll captures the total instability and contingency of media\ntransmission and reproduction.\nFinally, toward the end of his residency, Bochner began measuring things. First,\nBochner had Singer staffers themselves take Polaroids of the scenarios. Then he\nrephotographed the Polaroids, cropped them, and had the negatives developed as 8 x 10\ngelatin silver prints. In the pictures, mundane objects are shown scattered throughout the\noffice and lab. Black Letraset numbers and black tape mark off distances. Bochner\ndescribes the work as a manifestation of the failure of objective quantification and\ncommunication:\n\u201cI saved all of the notes and papers and doodles that we wrote while we were\nsitting around, and I turned those into a book called The Singer Notes, and as time\nwent on, the subject came to be objectification, how to communicate, and how to\ncommunicate objectively. It boiled down to the issue of measurement. So that\u2019s\nwhere measurement as an idea entered my work. Because the scientists would\nonly trust that. There\u2019s nothing else they would trust. If they didn\u2019t have a\nmeasurement, and it wasn\u2019t repeatable, then it wasn\u2019t trustworthy, and there was\nno communication. So at a certain point I had this idea I would come in early one\nday with some Letraset, and I randomly put different measurements around the\nlab. Not attached to anything. Just free floating on walls on doors on the floor. I\ndidn\u2019t tell anybody about it, I secretly went around. And they came in and\ndiscovered those, and of course that lead to a new round of questions, what does\nthis mean, how do you divorce measurement from an object, etcetera etcetera, led\n254 Skrebowski persuasively reads Roll as an emblem of the ways in which analog photography itself was\nalways already unmoored from the real: \u201cIn lieu of producing his proto-digital photographs, Bochner\nfocused on the \u2018phantoms\u2019 that haunted analogue visual media.\u201d Skrebowski, \u201cProductive\nMisunderstandings,\u201d 130-131.\n215"}
{"242": "to some really interesting conversation. And then I asked the in house\nphotographer to take some photographs of these, which he did, as\ndocumentation.\u201d255\nIndeed, it was only after looking at these 8 x 10 photos that Bochner realized that the\nmeasurements indicated within the image had absolutely no relationship to the distance\nthey marked on the print.\n\u201c[A]s I looked through this stack of photographs, I began to realize that here you\nhave a measurement written on something that purports to say what it is -- but in\nthe illusion of the photograph it\u2019s represented as something else. So twelve\ninches equals three inches, but how do you pull that information out? There was\nno way to know the actual size of the object in the photograph.\u201d256\nThis recognition spawned Bochner\u2019s \u201cMeasurements\u201d series, which would\ncontinue well after his residency at Singer. But the project also spurred the fundamental\nrealization that measurements do not simply denote actual distances: the two sit in an\nuneasy relation. As Scott Rothkopf has shown, the markings in Bochner\u2019s photographs\ndo not measure distances between things, as we normally use measurement; instead, they\nseem to hover between \u201carbitrary physical points.\u201d257 (Even in a photo with a span\nbetween a spray can and wall molding, the mark does not totally line up with the can,\nbecause of the angle of the photograph and its perspectival distortion.) In this way, the\nessential scalelessness of photography becomes startlingly explicit: in the spray can\nphoto, for example, \u201cten inches\u201d depicted is less than five in the actual print [Fig. 3.54].\nThis \u201ccleaves an a priori concept from the physical world it is meant to describe\u201d; it\n255 Mel Bochner, interview with the author, April 26, 2013.\n256 Mel Bochner, interview with the author, April 26, 2013.\n257 Rothkopf, \u201c\u2018Photography cannot record abstract ideas\u2019 and other misunderstandings,\u201d 35.\n216"}

And that\u2019s what led to the pieces Actual Size (Face) and Actual Size\n(Hand), both 1968, where I put a twelve-inch measurement on the wall, stood next to it,\ntook a face shot, took a hand shot, and then had the photograph printed so that the\nmeasurement was actual size in the print. Now you could tell the size of these objects,\nmaking the photograph directly answerable to the world outside itself.\u201d259 The result was\na tautology: \u201cThe measurement in the print would be exactly twelve inches, or actual\nsize. By doing that the photograph became the index of the index, or a vicious circle.\nThat, for me, was the end of photography.\u201d260\nBochner was exploring the transformation from one media to another, and more\nimportantly, from one set of quantifications to another. From actual measurement to its\nphotographic representation. And the end of photography, for Bochner, led him to \u201cstart\nthinking about real space as opposed to what seemed to be the representation of space.\u201d261\nWhich, in turn, led from photography into architectural space, to the Measurement\n258 Rothkopf, \u201c\u2018Photography cannot record abstract ideas\u2019 and other misunderstandings,\u201d 38.

Of course, once\nyou put the measurements of a gallery, or any space, on the walls as a sort of three-\ndimensional blueprint, you realize that it's still a form of representation. But what's\nchanged is significant. The viewer\u2019s experience has gone from a mediated one to one that\nis direct. At this point my concerns began evolving in a more phenomenological direction\n...\u201d263\nThe Measurement series were not simply about visual or spatial mediation.\nAccording to Bochner, the conversations with Webb and the other scientists were what\nreally constituted the work. The photographs are investigations of the different kinds of\nnarratives or discourses at play in art and technology: two kinds of language.\nThey also function as a kind of documentation of a specific environment, the\nvisual language of the laboratory: the Letraset, the linoleum floors and spare\narchitecture, the mundane office supplies. In this sense, the media forms of 1960s\nindustrial research are likened to that of photography\u2014to the entropic nature of\ncommunication, whether technological, scientific, or aesthetic. And, of course,\nphotography is what traditionally brought these discourses of art and technology together\nin the modernist era. Photography itself was predicated on the contingency of\ntransduction, conversion, of slowness, incommensurability. As Bochner states,\n\u201cWith photography you have the lab, the waiting times. In the 60\u2019s, the\nphotographic technology was so primitive, as opposed to what it is today, there\nare a lot of things you couldn\u2019t do.

But it was\nalso very different from the attitude of Conceptual artists, who treated the camera as a\nmere documentary device, as a way to dematerialize, to eliminate mediation (in favor of\nthe supposed transparency of linguistic or photographic signs).265 Bochner instead\n\u201cexplores the relationship between literal and representational, a relation he could not\nescape in photography itself\u2014and realizes that photography could not communicate ideas\nany more transparently than painting, or sculpture, or language itself.\u201d266\nAnd yet the Singer Notes also reveal something else about photography, apart\nfrom the realms of real and referent, or Minimalism or Conceptual art. Bochner was not\nonly exploring traditional photographic mediation, he was exploring the utterly new\nrelationship between material and code, between photography and the digital.267 The\nMeasurement pieces do not only mark the loss of indexicality, but point to the nascent\nredefinition of photography as a digital medium, as a medium of information, and of\nconversion between signal and noise, recognizing right from the start that this conversion\nwas never seamless or complete.\nThe question of analog-to-digital conversion and measurement was, in fact,\nforemost on the minds of Webb and the engineers at Singer.

This commitment to the large-\nscale in the long-term is what allowed so many Bell engineers to deviate from the main\nprogram.

One reason that we have been able to move\nso slow [sic] is that we are overwhelmed by letters, telephone calls from people\nwho are interested. It became clear in January that we had to do something.\nEither we would have to stick within the limits of Manhattan and return all the\nother letters, or we would have to organize on a national basis. And, as usually\nhappens, decisions are made between 11:30 and 12:00 at night. Paul suggested,\n\u2018Well, what do the churches do?\u2019 or \u2018the labor unions?\u2019 The idea to create local\ngroups which were as autonomous and corresponded to local needs and ideas\ncame up. As a result of that idea we got over forty people that wanted to start\nlocal groups in America, Europe and everywhere.\nSo Francis [Mason] and I have been traveling the country side to see many\nof you in other groups to deal with the loyalty and enthusiasm. The letters keep\ncoming and telephone lines are always busy. Now we are at a point where we can\nactually sit down and say, \u2018OK, we\u2019ve got all this interest of at least 20,000\npeople who know about EAT., what shall we do?\u2019 We get interest from\nuniversities, engineering societies, national science foundation, and even\nscientific establishments. Of course the art world is where it all comes from. But\nwe never thought we would get involved with the universities.\nWe still have the same problems however\u2026I believe the more eloquent\nand interesting way of solving this would be to establish a national organization\nwhere we have full-fledged E.A.T. groups using our name, tax exemption, what\nhave you, in the various cities (about five or six) across the United States. They\ncould be associated groups, not so formalized in other areas. There are of course\nother groups who are interested in the same subject that might want to be\nassociated with us. So, I think that here we all agree that the nicest solution\nwould be for E.A.T. to become a full-fledged national organization. We have the\npeople, ideas, and we are on the right side of the tracks. However, this implies\ncertain things. One, we must be able to operate here in New York and we must be\nable to sustain a yearly budget of between 200 and 250 thousand dollars which is\nwhat the minimum cost is to handle the daily flow of information. One of the\nimplications of the national organization is that we will have many ideas and\nexhibitions to cope with. There are many possibilities of generating national\nprojects which would actually go like waves across the country. They don\u2019t\nnecessarily have to be shows or exhibitions in the normal sense, it could be people\nconcentrating on computer or television or some material like our idea of the light\n91 Letter from Francis Mason to Jack Burnham, June 27, 1968.

We\u2019ve got four or five thousand artists, but we\nhaven\u2019t got the industry, and we haven\u2019t got the engineers, nor the facilities to put\nup large projects as other areas across the country do have.

The group held an Open House at Universal Studios\nwith Wilton Holm, the Vice President of the Association of Motion Picture and\nTelevision Producers and the Director of the AMPTP Research Center, in September\n1970; Holm published his lecture in an article in Survey 6, thereby expanding the\naudience of the Open House to the circulation of the journal.137 Titled \u201cMotion Pictures\nin an Evolving Culture,\u201d the piece outlined the deficiencies of the current state of\ncinematic projection, predicting new forms of video, 3-D and holographic film, and all\nmanner of illusive and immersive images. Even more important than the enhancement of\nthe picture would be the reach of its release: No longer printed and sent to theaters,\n\u201cDistribution by coaxial cable, microwave relay links or even by satellite would become\npossible. \u2026 TV will prosper, too. In perhaps 10 years all television is likely to come to\nthe home via cable because all homes will be \u2018wired\u2019\u2026.\u201d And the future of the motion\npicture industry depends on something far more intangible than ticket sales: \u2018In an\naffluent society, human needs tend to move up a scale from material goods toward a\ndesire for self-realization. Even the most avid consumer can use only so many TV sets or\nso many cars. Thus for a corporation to continue to serve a useful function, it has to\nredefine its role. It will have to create the qualities of life that people really want.\u201d What\nHolm is describing is, in other words, the experience economy to come.\nThe studio exec pushing for industrial innovation found an uncanny echo in Gene\nYoungblood\u2019s wild \u201cVideo Computer Interface\u201d in Survey 2 from February 1970.

It liberates him from\nspecialization.\u201d Against specialization, the computer \u201cis the arbiter of radical evolution.\nIt changes the meaning of life.\u201d138 And yet behind the hyperbole, Youngblood anchors\nthis universal shift in highly specific and local innovations: in the development of\ncomputer graphics. If the television could establish a continuous scan on the screen, new\ncomputer graphics systems, while still extremely expensive, time-consuming, and\ndemanded enormous amounts of memory, foreshadow the demise of video as we knew it.\n\u201cWe are quickly approaching that point at which real-time realistic computer-generated\nmotion graphics will be possible.\u201d Youngblood then details how \u201cthis was demonstrated\nto a group of E.A.T. members recently during a tour of Jet Propulsion Laboratories in\nPasadena. Scientists explained the MTC-1219 video system used in translating pictures\nof Mars in the various Mariner 69 encounter operations.

This was an understanding of perception that\nwas inextricable from the discourses of the cinema and the space mission, from the film\nindustry and the aerospace industry. It was an extraordinary collapse of the spectacular\nimage and the scientific image, perceptual models absolutely embedded in specific media\nhistories and sites.

As Kl\u00fcver wrote to Barbara Latham and\nAPG that fall: \u201cAfter my visits to London, Amsterdam and Paris, I feel it may be a\nserious mistake not to establish a strong international organization or association of\norganizations immediately.

Technology is international, and yet it is not universal. A vast field\nof possibility awaits in the translation and development of technology across\nfundamentally disparate contexts:\n\u201cThere has been spontaneous interest in our activities from all over the world and\nmany people have approached us for advice and help on starting E.A.T.\norganizations in their countries. Many activities have started on their own, and\nthe original E.A.T. idea has been carried out by individuals, independent groups,\nuniversities, museums, foundations.\n\u2026Pressures for something new come from the rate of development of\ntechnology, the consciousness of the degree of rate of change of the environment,\nthe increasing involvement of the technical community in problems in the\nenvironment, politicalization of the society in general and the artist in particular\nand general recognition of and concern about the man-machine relationship and\necological problems. The politicalization of the artist over the past year indicates\nthat the artist wants not only to change the art world but to move out of it into\ngreater social involvement. However, the technical community has become\ninvolved in problems in the environment at a faster rate than the art community.\nGiven the rate of change of non-art development, the artist is in a position of\nbecoming anachronistic and irrelevant; he is not taken seriously in those areas of\ndevelopment in the environment where he could make a valuable contribution.\nE.A.T. as an organization is based on the belief that the artist has a\nrelevant and necessary contribution to make in non-art areas in the social\nenvironment and is committed to developing as many forms in which the artist\ncan be full participant in projecting this area.\u201d148\nIn an astonishing and astonishingly prescient claim, E.A.T. argues that hardware is not\nneutral: we cannot assume that hardware can be seamlessly transferred between different\n146 See \u201cE.A.T.

He is valuable in\ndeveloping means for localizing the technology in terms of application, access\nand use, to support rather than destroy the indigenous cultural heritage and the\ndignity of the individual. There is growing recognition in the technical\ncommunity and elsewhere that the hardware need not be a fixed constant, and\nthere are no unalterable rules for using it. Whether a satellite or a tractor will\nbring a whole culture with it is an open question. But there is little known in this\narea of interface between the individual and technology and there is a great need\nfor open-ended experimentation. In such experimental situations the artists\u2019 input\nis needed.\nThese are international problems and concerns. Technology is spreading\nand the hardware is being taken up by all countries. The present structure of\nE.A.T. international contacts, which have developed from spontaneous random\ninterest, is totally inadequate and has not led to an expansion of E.A.T.\ninvolvement that corresponds to the scale of the problems and changes in the\nsocial and political environment. We plan to take the following action: E.A.T. in\nNew York will actively stimulate the setting up of independent parallel national\nE.A.T. organizations and work with them to establish an international forum for\nexchange of information hardware and people, and collaboration on projects on\ninternational scale.\nThe development of E.A.T. along these lines will begin with the\nestablishment of national organizations in Japan and India. The involvement in\nthe Pepsi Pavilion in Japan provided the contacts and impetus for the organization\nthere. Two projects in India generated initial contacts and interest. Japan is the\nmost industrialized nation in Asia and has begun to export technology; India is the\nmost acute developing nation undergoing rapid introduction for technology in a\nsituation of old, diverse and strong cultural traditions. The E.A.T. organizations\nwill be oriented to experimental projects outside a specific institutional\nframework which utilizes the skills and talents of different professionals,\nincluding the artist. In addition to doing projects inside the country, members of\nthese E.A.T. organizations would have direct contact with E.A.T. members in\nother countries to exchange information, experience, and collaborate on projects.\nAn indigenous E.A.T. organization combined with the international contact\nbetween E.A.T. organizations will provide interested people a means for effective\n284"}

The\nstructure of the art world and the social role of the artist everywhere has remained basically unchanged.\nOther forces for change have radically changed the situation. Pressures for something new come from\nthe rate of development of technology, the consciousness of the degree of rate of change of the\nenvironment, the increasing involvement of the technical community in problems in the environment,\npoliticalization of the society in general and the artist in particular and general recognition of and concern\nabout the man-machine relationship and ecological problems. The politicalization of the artist over the past\nyear indicates that the artist wants not only to change the art world but to move out of it into greater social\ninvolvement. However, the technical community has become involved in problems in the environment at a\nfaster rate than the art community. Given the rate of change of non-art development, the artist is in a\nposition of becoming anachronistic and irrelevant; he is not taken seriously in those areas of development\nin the environment where he could make a valuable contribution.\nE.A.T. as an organization is based on the belief that the artist has a relevant and necessary contribution\nto make in non-art areas in the social environment and is committed to developing as many forms in which\nthe artist can be full participant in projecting this area. The role of the artists in planning the Pepsi Pavilion\ndemonstrated their concern for the individual and their seriousness in using new technology to provide\nfreedom and variety in individual experience.\nOur experience has shown that the artist can make an important contribution in aspects of technology\nwhich involve the adaptation of technology to different cultures and environments, as it affects the\nindividual. He is valuable in developing means for localizing the technology in terms of application, access\nand use, to support rather than destroy the indigenous cultural heritage and the dignity of the individual.\nThere is growing recognition in the technical community and elsewhere that the hardware need not be a\nfixed constant, and there are no unalterable rules for using it. Whether a satellite or a tractor will bring a\nwhole culture with it is an open question. But there is little known in this area of interface between the\nindividual and technology and there is a great need for open-ended experimentation. In such experimental\nsituations the artists\u2019 input is needed.\nThese are international problems and concerns. Technology is spreading and the hardware is being\ntaken up by all countries. The present structure of E.A.T. international contacts, which have developed\nfrom spontaneous random interest, is totally inadequate and has not led to an expansion of E.A.T.\ninvolvement that corresponds to the scale of the problems and changes in the social and political\nenvironment. We plan to take the following action: E.A.T. in New York will actively stimulate the setting\nup of independent parallel national E.A.T. organizations and work with them to establish an international\nform for exchange of information hardware and people, and collaboration on projects on international\nscale.\nThe development of E.A.T. along these lines will begin with the establishment of national organizations\nin Japan and India. The involvement in the Pepsi Pavilion in Japan provided the contacts and impetus for\nthe organization there. Two projects in India generated initial contacts and interest. Japan is the most\nindustrialized nation in Asia and has begun to export technology; India is the most acute developing nation\nundergoing rapid introduction for technology in a situation of old, diverse and strong cultural traditions.\nThe E.A.T. organizations will be oriented to experimental projects outside a specific institutional\nframework which utilizes the skills and talents of different professionals, including the artist. In addition to\ndoing projects inside the country, members of these E.A.T. organizations would have direct contact with\nE.A.T. members in other countries to exchange information, experience, and collaborate on projects. An\nindigenous E.A.T. organization combined with the international contact between E.A.T. organizations will\nprovide interested people a means for effective action on the problems introduced by technology in\ndeveloped or undeveloped situations where the presence of the artist can have great importance.\u201d\n\u201cA Structure for E.A.T.

The Pepsi Pavilion, a giant dome created for\nthe world\u2019s fair in Osaka in 1970, was shrouded in an all-encompassing and ever-shifting\nfog [Fig. 4.11]. Inside, one wandered within a 90-foot-diameter, 210-degree spherical\nmirror\u2014the largest spherical mirror ever built. The optical effects were unprecedented:\nreflections that were fully three-dimensional, inverted, hovering in space [Fig. 4.12]. An\n173 Debord, The Society of the Spectacle (1967), trans.

{"341": "It is no coincidence that the telecommunications satellite provides the morphology\nfor the mirror dome. Indeed, the Pavilion is an inversion of the satellite mirror: the\nreflective surface as a communicative relay outward is here flipped inward, to an interior\nof illusion and transformation [see Fig. 4.25]. And the interior itself is suffused with a\nwireless broadcast network of its own, a web of radio waves and receiver handsets [Figs.\n4.46, 4.47]. This inversion betrays, I think, a fundamental anxiety about the loss of the\nsubject position in the global network. It betrays a deep-seated anxiety about the loss of\nresemblance itself, the disappearance of tangible reality within the amplifications and\nwaves and networks of modern telecommunications.228\nBut the Pavilion does not pose, as salvation, a vision of a seamless global\nvillage\u2014a utopian communications network, as so many works of expanded cinema or\nPop art would. Nor does it simply attempt a return to presence, to some stable real,\nlamenting the loss of authenticity or truth. Rather, the Pavilion plunges into illusion and\nphantasmagoria, into \u201canother order of reality entirely\u201d [Fig. 4.48].229 As simulacrum, it\nmaintains resemblance only to better undermine resemblance\u2019s \u201chold over the real,\u201d as\nCamille has so beautifully put it.230\nand Simulacrum\u201d (1981), in Baudrillard, Selected Writings, ed.

But I would argue that this does not\naccount for the radical multiplication and distortion of the reflected image, of the \u201creal\u201d and \u201cvirtual\u201d image,\nall reflected and multiplied again in second-, third- and multiple-order images. And I would also argue\nthat, unlike VanDerBeek\u2019s Movie Drome, the Pavilion was in fact the precise opposite of environments that\nrely on the projected image; instead, the Pavilion produced \u201creal\u201d and \u201cvirtual\u201d images, reflected in real\ntime; it did not produce speed and \u201cvisual velocity\u201d but slowness; it did not induce the viewer to take a\nstatic position (often lying down) but a perambulatory one; finally, the Pepsi Pavilion is not anti-illusion,\nbut rather pushes illusion to its limits. In this sense, I would caution against false binaries of\nreal/imaginary, which the Pavilion undoes in favor of a multiplicitous subject position.\n233 Camille, \u201cSimulacrum,\u201d 45.\n234 Nakaya, quoted in Lindgren, \u201cInto the Collaboration,\u201d 41.\n316"}

Such an assertion may seem surprising,\nsince the rise of technological automation after World War II is typically understood as\nthe vast implementation of control. From thermostats to computers, industrial production\nto information processing, automated systems aim at the sweeping simulation and\nregulation of cognition and action.1 But aims are not always met: Unpredictability, error,\nand malfunction are bound to the proliferation of control systems themselves. This\nturbulence is constitutive of the risk society, as defined by sociologist Ulrich Beck\u2014a\n1 \u201cControl,\u201d as we have seen, is the leitmotif that spans industrial production to artificial intelligence, from\nthe postwar fields of operations research and cybernetics to that of organizational theory.

Feedback mechanisms allow us to control machine\nsystems; planning devices (whether used by corporations or by government) allow us to anticipate\neconomic change and assess the consequences; organizational analysis can be used to locate strains or\ndisjunctions in complex social systems, be they hospitals, prisons, universities, voluntary associations, or\ncorporations; new intellectual tools, such as simulation or game theory, give us some means of providing a\nmore rational foundation for political decisions.\u201d Daniel Bell, \u201cPreface,\u201d Sir Leon Bagrit, The Age of\nAutomation: The BBC Reith Lecture Series 1964 (New York: Mentor Books, 1965), xi-xii.

Double-glazed sliding windows with operable blinds shielded\nthe interiors and created two-way and one-way mirror reflections.

But, Virno asserts, this\nresulted instead in unlimited flexibility in the use of labor-power, the proliferation of\nhierarchies, and therefore the \u201cre-establishment of archaic disciplinary measures to\ncontrol individuals no longer subject to the rules of the factory system.\u201d168 For Virno,\nthis cooptation occurred on the heels of the Italian autonomist protests in the mid- to late\n1970s, but it is clear that such mutations in both labor and radical thought were already at\n166 Paolo Virno, A Grammar of the Multitude, (Cambridge, Mass.: Semiotext(e), 2004), 98-99.\n167 Ibid., 100.\n168 Ibid., 101.\n38 4"}

Its endeavors came to\nplot the shifting limits of control systems themselves.

E.A.T. hoped to revoke the restriction of technical knowledge\nto privileged communities. At the same time, such technical information was constantly\nsubject to revision and obsolescence. This was, in other words, a mark of the mounting\ninstability of expertise. Both Giddens and Beck have held this volatility of expert\nknowledge to be a core feature of postwar risk society. Here, post-Fordist modes of\nknowledge production and control come undone. Giddens emphasizes science and\ntechnology as the epicenter of such flux:\n\u201cThe skeptical, mutable nature of science was for a long time insulated from the\nwider public domain\u2014an insulation which persisted so long as science and\ntechnology were relatively restricted in their effects on everyday life.

Systems theory is traditionally seen as the\nmanifestation of capitalist techno-science, its interest in homeostasis, management, and\ncontrol. Parsons\u2019s systems theory exemplified such a stance, in which social systems\nseek equilibrium (just as physical systems attain dynamic equilibrium) and control is\nattained through self-correction.

It was a venture at once pioneering and terrifying. Not a\ncontrol society, but a risk society.\n257 Here I draw on the analyses of Leo Marx, who has articulated the \u201caggrandizement\u201d of technological\ndomination by theories of postmodernism: \u201cA common feature of \u2026 the umbrella concept of\npostmodernism, is the decisive role accorded to the new electronic communications technologies. The\ninformation or knowledge these technologies are able to generate and to disseminate is said to constitute a\ndistinctively postmodern, increasingly dominant, form of capital, a \u201cforce of production,\u201d and in effect a\nnew, dematerialized kind of power. This allegedly is the age of knowledge-based economies\u2026 power, as\ndefined by these theories, is dynamic, fluid, always being moved, exchanged, transferred; it flows endlessly\nthrough the society and culture the way blood flows through a circulatory system, or information through a\ncommunications network \u2026 This kind of power is everywhere but concentrated nowhere.\u201d Marx\nconcludes, \u201cIn many respects postmodernism seems to be a perpetuation of\u2014and an acquiescence in\u2014the\ncontinuous aggrandizement of \u2018technology\u2019 in its modern, institutionalized, systemic guises.\u201d Although\nMarx identifies such a problematic stance with a \u201cshrunken sense of human agency\u2014of irresistible\ntechnological determinism\u201d\u2014I would argue that here the two viewpoints converge. In other words, a\nstrange and untenable coupling of humanism with technological determinism occurs when technological\nstructures are deemed to be so fatalistically and omnisciently dominant. Both such humanism and\ntechnological determinism may be seen as ways of repressing contingency, of attempting to find certainty\nin an age of risk. As Marx himself writes of postmodernism\u2019s fatalistic pessimism regarding technology,\n\u201cit might be well to acknowledge how consoling it is to attribute our pessimism to the workings of so\nelusive an agent of change.\u201d See Leo Marx, \u201cThe Idea of \u2018Technology\u2019 and Postmodern Pessimism,\u201d\nMerrill Roe Smith and Leo Marx, eds., Does Technology Drive History?: The Dilemma of Technological\nDeterminism (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1994), 256-257.\n41 9"}

In this sense, the\norganization represents the waning of modernist models of mass culture, which are\npredicated on older structures of collectivity and communication (as top-down mass\ncommunication rather than network technologies), and the presupposition of (unified and\nautonomous) subjects, individuals, and identities.\nWhat we see in the movement from E.A.T.\u2019s discrete collaborations to the Local\nGroups, Pepsi Pavilion, Artists and Television, Automation House, and Projects Outside\nArt is the movement from physical collectivities to informatic networks: to an\nincreasingly ephemeral sphere of telecommunications; to remote control; to the wireless\nworld so haltingly foreshadowed in 9 Evenings; to a form of individuation defined by\nconnections rather than autonomy; to big science.
